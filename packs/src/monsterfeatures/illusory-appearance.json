      "value": "<p>The {creature} covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the {creature} takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.</p><p>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the {creature} could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the {creature} is disguised.</p>",
