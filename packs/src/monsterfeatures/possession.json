When the possession ends, the {creature} reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this {creature}'s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</p></section><p>One humanoid that the {creature} can see within 5 ft. of it must make a <strong>Charisma</strong> saving throw.</p>",
