In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\n</section>\n<p>The {creature} targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 ft. of it.
