A centipede becomes a Giant Centipede, a Spider becomes a Giant Spider, a wasp becomes a Giant Wasp, and a Scorpion becomes a Giant Scorpion.</p><p>Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in Combat, they act on Your Turn each round. The DM has the Statistics for these creatures and resolves their Actions and Movement.</p><p>A creature remains in its giant size for the Duration, until it drops to 0 Hit Points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.</p><p>The DM might allow you to choose different Targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same Statistics as a Giant Wasp.</p>",
