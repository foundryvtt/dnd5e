You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the Duration. A creature that can see Invisile Objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.</p><p>Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.</p>",
