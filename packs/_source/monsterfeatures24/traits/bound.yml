      <p>The [[lookup @name lowercase]] is magically bound to an amulet. While
      the [[lookup @name lowercase]] and its amulet are on the same plane of
      existence, the amulet's wearer can telepathically call the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] to travel to it, and the [[lookup @name lowercase]] knows the
      distance and direction to the amulet. If the [[lookup @name lowercase]] is
      within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer, half of any damage the wearer takes
      (round up) is transferred to the [[lookup @name lowercase]].</p>
