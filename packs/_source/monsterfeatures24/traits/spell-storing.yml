  description:
    value: >-
      <p class="feature">A spellcaster who wears the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]]'s amulet can cause the [[lookup @name lowercase]] to store one
      spell of level 4 or lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the spell on the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] while within 5 feet of it. The spell has no
      effect but is stored within the [[lookup @name lowercase]]. Any previously
      stored spell is lost when a new spell is stored. The [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] can cast the spell stored with any parameters set by the
      original caster, requiring no spell components and using the caster's
      spellcasting ability. The stored spell is then lost.</p>
