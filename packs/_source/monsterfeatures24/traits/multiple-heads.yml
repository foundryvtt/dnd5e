      <p class="feature">The [[lookup @name lowercase]] has five heads. Whenever
      the [[lookup @name lowercase]] takes 25 damage or more on a single turn,
      one of its heads dies. The [[lookup @name lowercase]] dies if all its
      heads are dead. At the end of each of its turns when it has at least one
      living head, the [[lookup @name lowercase]] grows two heads for each of
      its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken Fire damage
      since its last turn. The [[lookup @name lowercase]] regains 20 Hit Points
      when it grows new heads.</p>
