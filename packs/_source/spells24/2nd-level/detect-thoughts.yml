      <p>You activate one of the effects below. Until the spell ends, you can
      activate either effect as a Magic action on your later
      turns.</p><p><strong>Sense Thoughts.</strong> You sense the presence of
      thoughts within 30 feet of yourself that belong to creatures that know
      languages or are telepathic. You don't read the thoughts, but you know
      that a thinking creature is present.</p><p>The spell is blocked by 1 foot
      of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of
      lead.</p><p><strong>Read Thoughts.</strong> Target one creature you can
      see within 30 feet of yourself or one creature within 30 feet of yourself
      that you detected with the Sense Thoughts option. You learn what is most
      on the target's mind right now. If the target doesn't know any languages
      and isn't telepathic, you learn nothing.</p><p>As a Magic action on your
      next turn, you can try to probe deeper into the target's mind. If you
      probe deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
      you discern the target's reasoning, emotions, and something that looms
      large in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save,
      the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its
      mind, and until you shift your attention away from the target's mind, the
      target can take an action on its turn to make an [[/check ability=int
      skill=arc dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against your spell save DC,
      ending the spell on a success.</p>
