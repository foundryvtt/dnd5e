      <p>You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs
      fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are
      &amp;Reference[difficultterrain], and the area within them is
      &amp;Reference[lightlyobscured].</p><p>If the webs aren't anchored between
      two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall,
      or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start
      of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5
      feet.</p><p>The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts
      its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the
      &amp;Reference[restrained] condition while in the webs or until it breaks
      free.</p><p>A creature Restrained by the webs can take an action to make a
      [[/check ability=str skill=ath dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against
      your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.</p><p>The
      webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in
      1 round, dealing [[/damage 2d4 type=fire]] damage to any creature that
      starts its turn in the fire.</p>
