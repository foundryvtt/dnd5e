    value: >-
      <p>For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an object
      you can see within range (see the chosen effect below). A targeted object
      must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature,
      it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell
      has no effect.</p><p>Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and
      carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at
      once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size
      immediately after it hits or misses a
      target.</p><p><strong>Enlarge.</strong> The target's size increases by one
      category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has Advantage
      on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with
      its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 damage on a
      hit.</p><p><strong>Reduce.</strong> The target's size decreases by one
      category—from Medium to Small, for example. The target also has
      Disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's
      attacks with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal 1d4 less damage
      on a hit (this can't reduce the damage below 1).</p>
