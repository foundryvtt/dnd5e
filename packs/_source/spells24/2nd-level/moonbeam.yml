      <p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius,
      40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell
      ends, Dim Light fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on
      later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.</p><p>When the Cylinder
      appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a
      failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is
      shape-shifted (as a result of the <em>Polymorph</em> spell, for example),
      it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the
      Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
      A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space
      and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature
      makes this save only once per turn.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot.</strong>The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level
      above 2.</p>
