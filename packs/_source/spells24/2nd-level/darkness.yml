  description:
    value: >-
      <p>For the duration, magical &amp;Reference[darkness] spreads from a point
      within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. Darkvision can't see
      through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.</p><p>Alternatively,
      you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing
      the Darkness to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object.
      Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks
      the Darkness.</p><p>If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of
      Bright Light or Dim Light created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that
      other spell is dispelled.</p>
