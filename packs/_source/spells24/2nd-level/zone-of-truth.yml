    value: >-
      <p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a
      15-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell
      ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn
      or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save,
      a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know
      whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save.</p><p>An affected
      creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which
      it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet
      must be truthful.</p>
