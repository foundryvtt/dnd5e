      <p>Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a
      door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that
      contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.</p><p>A target
      that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes
      unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one
      of them is unlocked.</p><p>If the target is held shut by <em>Arcane
      Lock</em>, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the
      target can be opened and closed.</p><p>When you cast the spell, a loud
      knock, audible up to 300 feet away, emanates from the target.</p>
