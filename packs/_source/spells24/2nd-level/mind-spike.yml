      <p>You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of one creature you
      can see within range. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8
      Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
      one. On a failed save, you also always know the target's location until
      the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of
      existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden
      from you, and if it has the &amp;Reference[invisible apply=false]
      condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against
      you.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. </strong>The damage
      increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.</p>
