    value: >-
      <p>You implant a message within an object in rangeâ€”a message that is
      uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see
      and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the
      message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over
      as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will
      trigger the spell to deliver your message.</p><p>When that trigger occurs,
      a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your
      voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a
      mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a
      statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from
      the object's mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end
      after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message
      whenever the trigger occurs.</p><p>The trigger can be as general or as
      detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible
      conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could
      instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the
      object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.</p>
