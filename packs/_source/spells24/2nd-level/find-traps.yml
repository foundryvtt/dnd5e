    value: >-
      <p>You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap,
      for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was
      created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the
      <em>Alarm</em> or <em>Glyph of Warding</em> spell or a mechanical pit
      trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable
      ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.</p><p>This spell reveals that a trap is
      present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the
      danger posed by a trap you sense.</p>
