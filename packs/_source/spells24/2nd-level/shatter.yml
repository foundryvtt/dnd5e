      <p>A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each
      creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution
      saving throw, taking 3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much
      damage on a successful one. A Construct has Disadvantage on the
      save.</p><p>A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also
      takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.</p><p><strong>Using a
      Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each
      spell slot level above 2.</p>
