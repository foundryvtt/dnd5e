    value: >-
      <p>A Line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in
      a direction you choose for the duration. Each creature in the Line must
      succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a
      direction following the Line. A creature that ends its turn in the Line
      must make the same save.</p><p>Any creature in the Line must spend 2 feet
      of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.</p><p>The
      gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles and similar
      unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those
      of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish
      them.</p><p>As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can change the
      direction in which the Line blasts from you.</p>
