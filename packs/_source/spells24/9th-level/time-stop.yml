      passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during
      which you can use actions and move as normal.</p><p>This spell ends if one
      of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create
      during it, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or
      carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move
