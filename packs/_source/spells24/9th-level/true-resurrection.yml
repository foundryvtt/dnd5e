    value: >-
      <p>You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years
      and that died for any reason except old age. The creature is revived with
      all its Hit Points.</p><p>This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any
      poison, cures all magical contagions, and lifts any curses affecting the
      creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and
      limbs. If the creature was Undead, it is restored to its non-Undead
      form.</p><p>The spell can provide a new body if the original no longer
      exists, in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature
      then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.</p>
