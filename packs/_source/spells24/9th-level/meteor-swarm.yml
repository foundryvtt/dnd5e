    value: >-
      <p>Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you
      can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on
      each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6
      Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much
      damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery
      Sphere is affected only once.</p><p>A nonmagical object that isn't being
      worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the
      object starts burning if it's flammable.</p>
