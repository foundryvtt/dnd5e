    value: >-
      <p>You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral
      bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already
      on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended
      animation; it has the &amp;Reference[Unconscious apply=false] condition,
      doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.</p><p>A target's astral form
      resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics
      and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery
      cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The
      cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only
      when an effect states that it does so—the target's body and astral form
      both die.</p><p>A target's astral form can travel through the Astral
      Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and
      possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter
      its body on the new plane.</p><p>Any damage or other effects that apply to
      an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a
      target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for
      that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action
      to dismiss it.</p><p>When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the
      target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended
      animation.</p>
