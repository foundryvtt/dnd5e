      <p>Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range.
      The creature shape-shifts into a different creature or a nonmagical
      object, or the object shape-shifts into a creature (the object must be
      neither worn nor carried). The transformation lasts for the duration or
      until the target dies or is destroyed, but if you maintain Concentration
      on this spell for the full duration, the spell lasts until
      dispelled.</p><p>An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and
      if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.</p><p><strong>Creature
      into Creature. </strong>If you turn a creature into another kind of
      creature, the new form can be any kind you choose that has a Challenge
      Rating equal to or less than the target's Challenge Rating or level. The
      target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the new form,
      but it retains its Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, alignment, and
      personality.</p><p>The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal
      to the Hit Points of the new form. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if
      any remain when the spell ends.</p><p>The target is limited in the actions
      it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast
      spells.</p><p>The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature
      can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that
      equipment.</p><p><strong>Object into Creature. </strong>You can turn an
      object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no
      larger than the object's size and the creature has a Challenge Rating of 9
      or lower. The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. In combat, it
      takes its turns immediately after yours, and it obeys your
      commands.</p><p>If the spell lasts more than an hour, you no longer
      control the creature. It might remain Friendly to you, depending on how
      you have treated it.</p><p><strong>Creature into Object. </strong>If you
      turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is
      wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object's size is no
      larger than the creature's size. The creature's statistics become those of
      the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form
      after the spell ends and it returns to normal.</p><section class="secret"
