      <p>You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you
      take a Magic action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new
      form must be of a creature that has a Challenge Rating no higher than your
      level or Challenge Rating. You must have seen the sort of creature before,
      and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.</p><p>When you cast the spell,
      you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the
      first form into which you shape-shift. These Temporary Hit Points vanish
      if any remain when the spell ends.</p><p>Your game statistics are replaced
      by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type;
      alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; Hit
      Points; Hit Point Dice; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you
      have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.</p><p>Upon
      shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground
      or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.</p>
