    value: >-
      <div><p>You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts for the
      duration. The door leads to an extradimensional dwelling and is 5 feet
      wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast
      the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the door
      remains open. You can open or close it (no action required) if you are
      within 30 feet of it. While closed, the door is
      imperceptible.</p><p>Beyond the door is a magnificent foyer with numerous
      chambers beyond. The dwelling's atmosphere is clean, fresh, and
      warm.</p><p>You can create any floor plan you like for the dwelling, but
      it can't exceed 50 contiguous 10-foot Cubes. The place is furnished and
      decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a
      nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. Furnishings and other objects
      created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from it.</p><p>A
      staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You
      determine the appearance of these servants and their attire. They are
      invulnerable and obey your commands. Each servant can perform tasks that a
      human could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would
      directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean,
      mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The
      servants can't leave the dwelling.</p><p>When the spell ends, any
      creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled
      into the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.</p></div>
