    value: >-
      <p>You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, where it
      overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for
      the duration. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move
      up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can perceive
      the plane you left, which looks gray, and you can't see anything there
      more than 60 feet away.</p><p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can affect
      and be affected only by creatures, objects, and effects on that plane.
      Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive or interact
      with you unless a feature gives them the ability to do so.</p><p>When the
      spell ends, you return to the plane you left in the spot that corresponds
      to your space in the Border Ethereal. If you appear in an occupied space,
      you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take Force damage
      equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</p><p>This spell ends
      instantly if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane
      that doesn't border it, such as one of the Outer
      Planes.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong>You can
      target up to three willing creatures (including yourself) for each spell
      slot level above 7. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you
      cast the spell.</p>
