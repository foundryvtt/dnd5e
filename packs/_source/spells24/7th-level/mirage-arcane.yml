      <p>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and
      even feel like some other sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be
      made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other rough or
      impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a
      precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and
      smooth road.</p><p>Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures
      or add them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal,
      or add creatures.</p><p>The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile,
      and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into Difficult Terrain
      (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece
      of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the
      spell's area disappears immediately.</p><p>Creatures with
      &amp;Reference[Truesight] can see through the illusion to the terrain's
      true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while
      the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still
      physically interact with the illusion.</p>
