      <p>You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration.
      The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen
      before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds
      like you, but it is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it
      disappears, and the spell ends.</p><p>You can see through the illusion's
      eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. As a Magic
      action, you can move it up to 60 feet and make it gesture, speak, and
      behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms
      perfectly.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be
      illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes the
      Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion
      with a successful [[/check ability=int skill=inv dc=@attributes.spell.dc]]
      check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for
      what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes
      sounds hollow to the creature.</p>
