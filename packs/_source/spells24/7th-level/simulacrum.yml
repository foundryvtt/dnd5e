    value: >-
      <p>You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid that is within 10 feet
      of you for the entire casting of the spell. You finish the casting by
      touching both the creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same size
      as that creature, and the pile turns into the simulacrum, which is a
      creature. It uses the game statistics of the original creature at the time
      of casting, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum is half as
      much, and it can't cast this spell.</p><p>The simulacrum is Friendly to
      you and creatures you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on your
      turn in combat. The simulacrum can't gain levels, and it can't take Short
      or Long Rests.</p><p>If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way to
      restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a Long Rest, during
      which you expend components worth 100 GP per Hit Point restored. The
      simulacrum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.</p><p>The
      simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points, at which point it reverts
      to snow and melts away. If you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you
      created with this spell is instantly destroyed.</p>
