      <p>This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures
      that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within
      range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be
      Large or smaller, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling
      creature.</p><p>The destination you choose must be known to you, and it
      must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the
      destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls
      [[/gmr 1d100]] and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the
      explanations after
      it.</p><details><summary><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.phbsplTeleportMi]{Teleportation

      Here are the meanings of the terms in the table's Familiarity
      column:</p><ul><li>"Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation
      circle whose sigil sequence you know.</li><li>"Linked object" means you
      possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six
      months, such as a book from a wizard's library.</li><li>"Very familiar" is
      a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a
      place you can see when you cast the spell.</li><li>"Seen casually" is a
      place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very
      familiar.</li><li>"Viewed once or described" is a place you have seen
      once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else's
      description, perhaps from a map.</li><li>"False destination" is a place
      that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but
      instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a
      location that no longer exists.</li></ul><p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The
      spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each
      teleporting creature (or the target object) takes [[/damage 3d10
      type=force]] damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind
      up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each
      time).</p><p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the
      target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically
      similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If
      you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in
      another person's laboratory in the same city.</p><p><strong>Off
      Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear [[/r
      2d12]] miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll [[/r
      1d8]] for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5,
      west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.</p><p><strong>On
      Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear where
      you intended.</p>
