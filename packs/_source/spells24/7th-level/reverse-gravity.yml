    value: >-
      <p>This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high Cylinder
      centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects in that area
      that aren't anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the
      Cylinder. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed
      object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall upward.</p><p>If a ceiling or
      an anchored object is encountered in this upward fall, creatures and
      objects strike it just as they would during a downward fall. If an
      affected creature or object reaches the Cylinder's top without striking
      anything, it hovers there for the duration. When the spell ends, affected
      objects and creatures fall downward.</p>
