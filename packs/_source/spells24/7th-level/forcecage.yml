    value: >-
      <p>An immobile, Invisible, Cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
      springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison
      can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.</p><p>A prison in the shape
      of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch
      diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box can be
      up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter
      from passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the
      area.</p><p>When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely
      inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the
      area, or those too large to fit inside it, are pushed away from the center
      of the area until they are completely outside it.</p><p>A creature inside
      the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use
      teleportation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first make a [[/save
      ability=cha dc=@attributes.spell.dc format=long]]. On a successful save,
      the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failed save, the
      creature doesn't exit the cage and wastes the spell or effect. The cage
      also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.</p><p>This
      spell can't be dispelled by <em>Dispel Magic</em>.</p>
