    value: >-
      <p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are
      transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target
      destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental
      Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine
      Hells, and you appear in or near that destination, as determined by the
      DM.</p><p>Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation
      circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that
      circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures
      you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the
      circle.</p>
