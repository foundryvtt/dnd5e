      <div><p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube
      that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The
      spell lasts for the duration.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you decide
      what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following
      properties:</p><ul><li>Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of
      the warded area.</li><li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and
      foggy, preventing vision (including &amp;Reference[Darkvision]) through
      it.</li><li>Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the
      protected area or pass through the barrier at its
      perimeter.</li><li>Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination
      spells.</li><li>Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded
      area.</li><li>Planar travel is blocked within the warded
      area.</li></ul><p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365
      days makes the spell last until dispelled.</p><p><strong>Using a
      Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> You can increase the size of the Cube by
      100 feet for each spell slot level above 4.</p></div>
