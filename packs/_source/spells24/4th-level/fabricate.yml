    value: >-
      <p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For
      example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope
      from a patch of hemp, or clothes from flax or wool.</p><p>Choose raw
      materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or
      smaller object (contained within a 10-foot Cube or eight connected 5-foot
      Cubes) given a sufficient quantity of material. If you're working with
      metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object
      can be no larger than Medium (contained within a 5-foot Cube). The quality
      of any fabricated objects is based on the quality of the raw
      materials.</p><p>Creatures and magic items can't be created by this spell.
      You also can't use it to create items that require a high degree of
      skill—such as weapons and armor—unless you have proficiency with the type
      of Artisan's Tools used to craft such objects.</p>
