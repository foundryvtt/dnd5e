    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into
      a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift
      into a Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose
      that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target's (or the
      target's level if it doesn't have a Challenge Rating). The target's game
      statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the
      target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and
      Hit Point Dice. See appendix B for a sample of Beast stat
      blocks.</p><p>The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to
      the Hit Points of the Beast form. These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any
      remain when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the target if it has
      no Temporary Hit Points left.</p><p>The target is limited in the actions
      it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast
      spells.</p><p>The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature
      can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.</p>
