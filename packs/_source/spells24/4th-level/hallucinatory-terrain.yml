    value: >-
      <p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot Cube in range look, sound, and
      smell like another sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road
      can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult
      or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a
      precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and
      smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the
      area aren't changed.</p><p>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are
      unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to notice the
      illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature examining
      the illusion can take the Study action to make an [[/check ability=int
      skill=inv dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against your spell save DC to
      disbelieve it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory, the
      creature sees a vague image superimposed on the real terrain.</p>
