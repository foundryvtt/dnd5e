name: Control Water

    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose
      that is a Cube up to 100 feet on a side, using one of the following
      effects. As a Magic action on your later turns, you can repeat the same
      effect or choose a different one.</p><p><strong>Flood. </strong>You cause
      the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20
      feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a
      20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and
      then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried
      with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave
      have a [[/r 1d100cs&lt;26#Vehicle is capsized]]{25 percent} chance of
      capsizing.</p><p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or
      you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave
      repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect
      lasts.</p><p><strong>Part Water. </strong>You part water in the area and
      create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the
      separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the
      spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills
      in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water
      level is restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow. </strong>You cause flowing
      water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has
      to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The
      water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the
      spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water
      continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you
      choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool. </strong>You cause a
      whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50
      feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a
      different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the
      base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the
      water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it.
      When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends
      its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature
      takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool
      only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a [[/check
      ability=str skill=ath dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against your spell
      save DC.</p>
