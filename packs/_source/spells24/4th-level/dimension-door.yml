    value: >-
      <p>You teleport to a location within range. You arrive at exactly the spot
      desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you
      can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight
      downward" or "300 feet upward to the northwest at a 45-degree
      angle."</p><p>You can also teleport one willing creature. The creature
      must be within 5 feet of you when you teleport, and it teleports to a
      space within 5 feet of your destination space.</p><p>If you, the other
      creature, or both would arrive in a space occupied by a creature or
      completely filled by one or more objects, you and any creature traveling
      with you each take 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails.</p>
