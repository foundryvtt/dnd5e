    value: >-
      <p>This spell puts you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask
      one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7
      days. The DM offers a truthful reply, which might be a short phrase or
      cryptic rhyme. The spell doesn't account for circumstances that might
      change the answer, such as the casting of other spells.</p><p>If you cast
      the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a
      cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get
      no answer.</p>
