      movement.</p><p>The spell can locate a specific creature known to you or
      the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) if
      you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If
      the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as under
      the effects of a
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplFleshtoSto]{Flesh to
      Stone}</em> or
