      <p>Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed
      on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition until the spell
      ends.</p><p>For the duration, you can take a Bonus Action to designate a
      direction that is horizontal to you. Each &amp;Reference[Charmed
      apply=false] target must use as much of its movement as possible to move
      in that direction on its next turn, taking the safest route. After moving
      in this way, a target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a
      success.</p>
