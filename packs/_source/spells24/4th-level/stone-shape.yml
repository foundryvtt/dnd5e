    value: >-
      <p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of
      stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape you
      like. For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or
      coffer, or you could make a small passage through a wall that is 5 feet
      thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door
      shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but
      finer mechanical detail isn't possible.</p>
