    value: >-
      <p>You imbue plants in an immobile 30-foot Emanation with limited
      sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you
      and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in
      the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures
      that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.</p><p>You can also
      turn &amp;Reference[difficultterrain] caused by plant growth (such as
      thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the
      duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into
      Difficult Terrain that lasts for the duration.</p><p>The spell doesn't
      enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can move their
      branches, tendrils, and stalks for you.</p><p>If a Plant creature is in
      the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common
      language.</p>
