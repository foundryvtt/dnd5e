    value: >-
      <p>A willing creature you touch shape-shifts, along with everything it's
      wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends
      on the target if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if it takes a Magic action to
      end the spell on itself.</p><p>While in this form, the target's only
      method of movement is a Fly Speed of 10 feet, and it can hover. The target
      can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has
      Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; it has Immunity
      to the &amp;Reference[prone apply=false] condition; and it has Advantage
      on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can
      pass through narrow openings, but it treats liquids as though they were
      solid surfaces.</p><p>The target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any
      objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise
      interacted with. Finally, the target can't attack or cast
      spells.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> You can
      target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3.</p>
