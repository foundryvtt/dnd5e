    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell.
      The creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
      spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction
      used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the
      slot isn't expended.</p>
