    value: >-
      <p>A 10-foot Emanation springs into existence around you and remains
      stationary for the duration. The spell fails when you cast it if the
      Emanation isn't big enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its
      area.</p><p>Creatures and objects within the Emanation when you cast the
      spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are
      barred from passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can't be cast
      through it, and the effects of such spells can't extend into it.</p><p>The
      atmosphere inside the Emanation is comfortable and dry, regardless of the
      weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to
      have &amp;Reference[dimlight] or &amp;Reference[darkness] (no action
      required). The Emanation is opaque from the outside and of any color you
      choose, but it's transparent from the inside.</p><p>The spell ends early
      if you leave the Emanation or if you cast it again.</p>
