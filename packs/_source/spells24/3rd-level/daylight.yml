    value: >-
      <p>For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills
      a 60-foot-radius Sphere. The sunlight's area is Bright Light and sheds Dim
      Light for an additional 60 feet.</p><p>Alternatively, you cast the spell
      on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to
      fill a 60-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that
      object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the
      sunlight.</p><p>If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of
      Darkness created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is
      dispelled.</p>
