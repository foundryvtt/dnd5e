      <p>You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to
      you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location
      that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a
      grove of trees). The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for
      the duration.</p><p>When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You
      can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space.
      As a Bonus Action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.</p><p>A
      creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from <em>See
      Invisibility</em> or &amp;Reference[truesight]) sees a luminous orb about
      the size of your fist.</p>
