name: Glyph of Warding

    value: >-
      <p>You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You
      inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor) or
      within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal
      the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter.
      If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast
      this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being
      triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a
      successful [[/check ability=wis skill=prc dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check
      against your spell save DC to notice.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph,
      you set its trigger and choose whether it's an explosive rune or a spell
      glyph, as explained below.</p><p><strong>Set the Trigger.</strong> You
      decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs
      inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on
      the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a
      certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common
      triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph. Once a glyph is
      triggered, this spell ends.</p><p>You can refine the trigger so that only
      creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be
      set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that
      don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain
      password.</p><p><strong>Explosive Rune.</strong> When triggered, the glyph
      erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the
      glyph. Each creature in the area makes a [[/save ability=dex
      dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 [[/damage
      (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Acid}, [[/damage (@item.level + 2)d8
      type=acid]]{Cold}, [[/damage (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Fire},
      [[/damage (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Lightning}, or [[/damage
      (@item.level + 2)d8 type=acid]]{Thunder} damage (your choice when you
      create the glyph) on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</p><p><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong> You can store a prepared spell of
      level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph.
      The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored
      has no immediate effect when cast in this way.</p><p>When the glyph is
      triggered, the stored spell takes effect. If the spell has a target, it
      targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an
      area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile
      creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as
      possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires
      Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full
      duration.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The
      damage of an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level
      above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the
      same level as the spell slot you use for the <em>Glyph of
      Warding</em>.</p><section class="secret"
