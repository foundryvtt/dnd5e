    value: >-
      <p>You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain
      your body, merging yourself and your equipment with the stone for the
      duration. You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your presence
      remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.</p><p>While
      merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any
      [[/check ability=wis skill=prc]] checks you make to hear sounds outside it
      are made with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and
      can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet
      of movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell.
      You otherwise can't move.</p><p>Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't
      harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the
      extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals [[/damage
      6d6 type=force]] damage to you. The stone's complete destruction (or
      transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals [[/damage
      50 type=force]] damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoccupied
      space closest to where you first entered and have the
      &amp;Reference[prone] condition.</p>
