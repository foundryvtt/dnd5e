    value: >-
      <p>You send a short message of 25 words or fewer to a creature you have
      met or a creature described to you by someone who has met it. The target
      hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows
      you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables
      targets to understand the meaning of your message.</p><p>You can send the
      message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if
      the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance
      that the message doesn't arrive. You know if the delivery
      fails.</p><p>Upon receiving your message, a creature can block your
      ability to reach it again with this spell for 8 hours. If you try to send
      another message during that time, you learn that you are blocked, and the
      spell fails.</p>
