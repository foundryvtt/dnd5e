      <p>Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within
      range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a
      <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSkeleton000000]{Skeleton}</strong>
      if you chose bones or a
      <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmZombie00000000]{Zombie}</strong>
      if you chose a corpse.</p><p>On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus
      Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the
      creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you
      can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each
      one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move
      on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a
      chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the
      Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the
      creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p><p>The
      creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying
      any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for
      another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before
      the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your
      control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell rather
      than animating a new creature.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell
      Slot.</strong> You animate or reassert control over two additional Undead
      creatures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the creatures must
      come from a different corpse or pile of bones.</p>
