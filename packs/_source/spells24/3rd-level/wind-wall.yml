    value: >-
      <p>A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose
      within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and
      1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it
      makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the
      duration.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a
      Strength saving throw, taking 4d8 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or
      half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The strong wind keeps fog,
      smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or
      objects can't pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought
      into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles
      launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and miss
      automatically. Boulders hurled by Giants or siege engines, and similar
      projectiles, are unaffected. Creatures in gaseous form can't pass through
      it.</p>
