      <p>You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall Cylinder of magical energy
      centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing
      runes appear wherever the Cylinder intersects with the floor or other
      surface.</p><p>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures:
      Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a
      creature of the chosen type in the following ways:</p><ul><li>The creature
      can't willingly enter the Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature
      tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first
      succeed on a Charisma saving throw.</li><li>The creature has Disadvantage
      on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.</li><li>Targets
      within the Cylinder can't be possessed by or gain the
      &amp;Reference[charmed apply=false] or &amp;reference[frightened
      apply=false] condition from the creature.</li></ul><p>Each time you cast
      this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction,
      preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder and
      protecting targets outside it.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell
      Slot.</strong> The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level
      above 3.</p>
