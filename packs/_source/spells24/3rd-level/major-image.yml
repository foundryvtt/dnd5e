    value: >-
      <p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a
      spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems
      real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing
      depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause conditions.</p><p>If you are
      within range of the illusion, you can take a Magic action to cause the
      image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes
      location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear
      natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature
      and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
      Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at
      different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for
      example.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
      illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study
      action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a
      successful [[/check ability=int skill=inv dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check
      against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what
      it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory
      qualities become faint to the creature.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level
      Spell Slot.</strong> The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring
      Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell slot.</p>
