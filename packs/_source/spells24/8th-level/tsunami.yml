    value: >-
      <p>A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within
      range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50
      feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.</p><p>When the wall appears,
      each creature in its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 6d10
      Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</p><p>At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the
      wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any
      Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters
      when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10
      Bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round.
      At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the
      damage the wall deals on later rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall
      reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.</p><p>A creature caught in the
      wall can move by swimming. Because of the wave's force, though, the
      creature must succeed on a [[/check ability=str skill=ath
      dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against your spell save DC to move at all.
      If it fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out of the
      wall falls to the ground.</p><section class="secret"

      activity consumes one use to represent one round passing and uses the
