    value: >-
      <p>Choose a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the
      duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius
      circle centered on that point. The ground there is Difficult
      Terrain.</p><p>When you cast this spell and at the end of each of your
      turns for the duration, each creature on the ground in the area makes a
      Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has the
      &amp;Reference[Prone] condition, and its Concentration is
      broken.</p><p>You can also cause the effects
      below.</p><p><strong>Fissures.</strong> A total of [[/r 1d6]] fissures
      open in the spell's area at the end of the turn you cast it. You choose
      the fissures' locations, which can't be under structures. Each fissure is
      [[/r 1d10 * 10]] feet deep and 10 feet wide, and it extends from one edge
      of the spell's area to another edge. A creature in the same space as a
      fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature
      that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it
      opens.</p><p><strong>Structures.</strong> The tremor deals [[/damage 50
      type=bludgeoning]] damage to any structure in contact with the ground in
      the area when you cast the spell and at the end of each of your turns
      until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it
      collapses.</p><p>A creature within a distance from a collapsing structure
      equal to half the structure's height makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a
      failed save, the creature takes 12d6 Bludgeoning damage, has the
      &amp;Reference[Prone apply=false] condition, and is buried in the rubble,
      requiring a [[/check ability=str skill=ath dc=20]] check as an action to
      escape. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage
      only.</p>
