      <p>You touch a creature or at least 1 cubic inch of its flesh. An inert
      duplicate of that creature forms inside the vessel used in the spell's
      casting and finishes growing after 120 days; you choose whether the
      finished clone is the same age as the creature or younger. The clone
      remains inert and endures indefinitely while its vessel remains
      undisturbed.</p><p>If the original creature dies after the clone finishes
      forming, the creature's soul transfers to the clone if the soul is free
      and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original
      and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the
      original's equipment. The creature's original remains, if any, become
      inert and can't be revived, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.</p>
