    value: >-
      <p>One creature you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving
      throw or have the &amp;Reference[Charmed apply=false] condition for the
      duration. The target has Advantage on the save if you or your allies are
      fighting it. Whenever the target takes damage, it repeats the save, ending
      the spell on itself on a success.</p><p>You have a telepathic link with
      the Charmed target while the two of you are on the same plane of
      existence. On your turn, you can use this link to issue commands to the
      target (no action required), such as "Attack that creature," "Move over
      there," or "Fetch that object." The target does its best to obey on its
      turn. If it completes an order and doesn't receive further direction from
      you, it acts and moves as it likes, focusing on protecting
      itself.</p><p>You can command the target to take a Reaction but must take
      your own Reaction to do so.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell
      Slot.</strong> Your Concentration can last longer with a level 9 spell
      slot (up to 8 hours).</p>
