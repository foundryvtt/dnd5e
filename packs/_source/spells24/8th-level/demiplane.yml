    value: >-
      <p>You create a shadowy Medium door on a flat solid surface that you can
      see within range. This door can be opened and closed, and it leads to a
      demiplane that is an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or
      stone (your choice).</p><p>When the spell ends, the door vanishes, and any
      objects inside the demiplane remain there. Any creatures inside also
      remain unless they opt to be shunted through the door as it vanishes,
      landing with the &amp;Reference[Prone] condition in the unoccupied spaces
      closest to the door's former space.</p><p>Each time you cast this spell,
      you can create a new demiplane or connect the shadowy door to a demiplane
      you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you
      know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this
      spell by another creature, you can connect the shadowy door to that
      demiplane instead.</p>
