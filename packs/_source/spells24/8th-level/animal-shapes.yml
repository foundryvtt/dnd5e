      <p>Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range.
      Each target shape-shifts into a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that
      has a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for
      each target. On later turns, you can take a Magic action to transform the
      targets again.</p><p>A target's game statistics are replaced by the chosen
      Beast's statistics, but the target retains its creature type; Hit Points;
      Hit Point Dice; alignment; ability to communicate; and Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target's actions are limited by the Beast
      form's anatomy, and it can't cast spells. The target's equipment melds
      into the new form, and the target can't use any of that equipment while in
      that form.</p><p>The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal
      to the Beast form's Hit Points. The transformation lasts for the duration
      for each target, until the target has no Temporary Hit Points, or until
      the target leaves the form as a Bonus Action.</p>
