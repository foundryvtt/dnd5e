      <p>You touch a dead Humanoid or a piece of one. If the creature has been
      dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new body for it and calls
      the soul to enter that body.

      classes="caption-top"]</p><p>The reincarnated creature makes any choices
      that a species' description offers, and the creature recalls its former
      life. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it
      loses the traits of its previous species and gains the traits of its new
      one.</p>
