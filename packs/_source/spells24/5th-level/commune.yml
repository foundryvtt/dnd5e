      <p>You contact a deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions
      that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before
      the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each
      question.</p><p>Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might
      receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that
      lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could
      be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a
      short phrase as an answer instead.</p><p>If you cast the spell more than
      once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance
      for each casting after the first that you get no answer.</p>
