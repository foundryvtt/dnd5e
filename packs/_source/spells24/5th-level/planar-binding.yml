    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend to
      your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of
      the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of
      the inverted version of the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMagicCircl]{Magic
      Circle}</em> spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the completion
      of the casting, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be
      bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or
      created by another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the
      duration of this spell.</p><p>A bound creature must follow your commands
      to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany
      you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the
      creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your commands to achieve its own
      objectives. If the creature carries out your commands completely before
      the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the
      same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane, it returns to
      the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell
      ends.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The duration
      increases with a spell slot of level 6 (10 days), 7 (30 days), 8 (180
      days), and 9 (366 days).</p>
