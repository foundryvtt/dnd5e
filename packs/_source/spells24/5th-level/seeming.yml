    value: >-
      <p>You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that
      you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving
      throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.</p><p>You can
      give the same appearance or different ones to the targets. The spell can
      change the appearance of the targets' bodies and equipment. You can make
      each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear heavier or lighter.
      A target's new appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs as
      the target, but the extent of the illusion is otherwise up to you. The
      spell lasts for the duration.</p><p>The changes wrought by this spell fail
      to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to
      add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat.</p><p>A
      creature that takes the Study action to examine a target can make an
      [[/check ability=int skill=inv dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against
      your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is
      disguised.</p>
