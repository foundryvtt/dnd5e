    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that
      you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting
      the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target
      has the &amp;Reference[Charmed apply=false] condition for the duration.
      While Charmed in this way, the target also has the
      &amp;Reference[Incapacitated apply=false] condition and is unaware of its
      surroundings, though it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is
      targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and no memories are
      modified.</p><p>While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory
      of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted
      no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the
      event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change
      its memory of the event's details, or create a memory of some other
      event.</p><p>You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are
      affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified
      memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your
      description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified
      memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified
      memories take hold when the spell ends.</p><p>A modified memory doesn't
      necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory
      contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An
      illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the creature
      enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The DM might deem a
      modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature.</p><p>A
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{Remove
      Curse}</em> or
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGreaterRes]{Greater
      Restoration}</em> spell cast on the target restores the creature's true
      memory.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> You can
      alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago
      (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago
      (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the creature's past (level 9 spell
      slot).</p>
