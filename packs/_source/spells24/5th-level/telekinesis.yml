      <p>You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by
      thought. When you cast the spell and as a Magic action on your later turns
      before the spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature or object
      that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You
      can affect the same target round after round or choose a new one at any
      time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the
      spell.</p><p><strong>Creature.</strong> You can try to move a Huge or
      smaller creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or
      you move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range. Until
      the end of your next turn, the creature has the &amp;Reference[Restrained]
      condition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended there. It
      falls at the end of your next turn unless you use this option on it again
      and it fails the save.</p><p><strong>Object.</strong> You can try to move
      a Huge or smaller object. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you
      automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's
      range.</p><p>If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature
      must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you pull the object away and
      move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range.</p><p>You
      can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as
      manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or
      retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a
      vial.</p>
