    value: >-
      <p>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some
      other knowledgeable entity from another plane. Contacting this
      otherworldly intelligence can break your mind. When you cast this spell,
      make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, you can ask
      the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the
      spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes,"
      "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't
      know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be
      misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an
      answer.</p><p>On a failed save, you take 6d6 Psychic damage and have the
      &amp;Reference[Incapacitated] condition until you finish a Long Rest. A
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGreaterRes]{Greater
      Restoration}</em> spell cast on you ends this effect.</p>
