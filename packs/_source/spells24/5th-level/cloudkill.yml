    value: >-
      <p>You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a
      point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind
      (such as the one created by <em>Gust of Wind</em>) disperses it, ending
      the spell. Its area is Heavily Obscured.</p><p>Each creature in the Sphere
      makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 Poison damage on a failed
      save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make
      this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the
      Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per
      turn.</p><p>The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of
      your turns.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The
      damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.</p>
