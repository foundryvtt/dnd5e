    value: >-
      <p>You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious
      gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or
      Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that
      isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability
      to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it
      becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots,
      vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's.
      The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the
      statistics for the
      <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.gaSTr7DFZJLmgI2J]{Awakened
      Shrub}</strong> or
      <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.UR2gWLFHmFwG7ReH]{Awakened
      Tree}</strong> in the <em>Monster Manual</em>.</p><p>The awakened target
      has the &amp;Reference[Charmed] condition for 30 days or until you or your
      allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature
      chooses its attitude toward you.</p>
