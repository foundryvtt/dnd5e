name: Wall of Stone
system:
  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you
      choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten
      10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another
      panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are
      only 3 inches thick.</p><p>If the wall cuts through a creature's space
      when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you
      choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the
      wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a
      Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move up
      to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p><p>The wall
      can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a
      creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on a firm
      foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by
      existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a
      ramp.</p><p>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must
      halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the
      wall to create battlements and the like.</p><p>The wall is an object made
      of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and
      30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has Immunity to Poison and
      Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might
      cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.</p><p>If you
      maintain your Concentration on this spell for its full duration, the wall
      becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears
      when the spell ends.</p>
