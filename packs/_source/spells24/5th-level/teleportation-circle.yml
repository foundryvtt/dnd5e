    value: >-
      <p>As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle on the ground
      inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation
      circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the
      same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the
      circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any
      creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the
      destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is
      occupied.</p><p>Many major temples, guildhalls, and other important places
      have permanent teleportation circles. Each circle includes a unique sigil
      sequenceâ€”a string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.</p><p>When
      you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil
      sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the
      DM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You
      can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1
      minute.</p><p>You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting
      this spell in the same location every day for 365 days.</p>
