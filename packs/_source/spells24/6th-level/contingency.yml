      <p>Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a
      casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that
      spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting <em>Contingency</em>,
      expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into
      effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You
      describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a
      <em>Contingency</em> cast with <em>Water Breathing</em> might stipulate
      that <em>Water Breathing</em> comes into effect when you are engulfed in
      water or a similar liquid.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect
      immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not
      you want it to, and then <em>Contingency</em> ends.</p><p>The contingent
      spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You
      can use only one <em>Contingency</em> spell at a time. If you cast this
      spell again, the effect of another <em>Contingency</em> spell on you ends.
      Also, <em>Contingency</em> ends on you if its material component is ever
      not on your person.</p><section class="secret"

      "create contingency" activity is configured to optionally enchant a Scroll
      to track and serve as the triggered spell. Create a spell scroll by right
      clicking on a spell in your spell list, expend a spell slot of the created
      scroll's level, and enchant the scroll.</p></section>
