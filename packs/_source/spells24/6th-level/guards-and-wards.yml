    value: >-
      <p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space.
      The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and you shape it as one 50-foot
      square, one hundred 5-foot squares that are contiguous, or twenty-five
      10-foot squares that are contiguous.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you
      can specify individuals that are unaffected by the spell's effects. You
      can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud within 5 feet of the
      warded area, makes the speaker immune to its effects.</p><p>The spell
      creates the effects below within the warded area.
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel
      Magic}</em> has no effect on <em>Guards and Wards</em> itself, but each of
      the following effects can be dispelled. If all four are dispelled,
      <em>Guards and Wards</em> ends. If you cast the spell every day for 365
      days on the same area, the spell thereafter lasts until all its effects
      are dispelled.</p><p><strong>Corridors.</strong> Fog fills all the warded
      corridors, making them &amp;Reference[HeavilyObscured]. In addition, at
      each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction,
      there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you believes it is
      going in the opposite direction from the one it
      chooses.</p><p><strong>Doors.</strong> All doors in the warded area are
      magically locked, as if sealed by the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplArcaneLock]{Arcane
      Lock}</em> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an
      illusion to make them appear as plain sections of
      wall.</p><p><strong>Stairs.</strong> Webs fill all stairs in the warded
      area from top to bottom, as in the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWeb0000000]{Web}</em>
      spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are destroyed while
      <em>Guards and Wards</em> lasts.</p><p><strong>Other Spell Effect.
      </strong>Place one of the following magical effects within the warded
      area:</p><ul><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDancingLig]{Dancing
      Lights}</em> in four corridors, with a simple program that the lights
      repeat as long as <em>Guards and Wards</em>
      lasts</li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMagicMouth]{Magic
      Mouth}</em> in two
      locations</li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplStinkingCl]{Stinking
      Cloud}</em> in two locations (the vapors return within 10 minutes if
      dispersed while <em>Guards and Wards</em>
      lasts)</li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGustofWind]{Gust
      of Wind}</em> in one corridor or room (the wind blows continuously while
      the spell
      lasts)</li><li><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplSuggestion]{Suggestion}</em>
      in one 5-foot square; any creature that enters that square receives the
      suggestion mentally</li></ul>
