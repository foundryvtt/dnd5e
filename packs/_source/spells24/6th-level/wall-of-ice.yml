name: Wall of Ice

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form
      it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or
      you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each
      panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1
      foot thick and lasts for the duration.</p><p>If the wall cuts through a
      creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of
      the wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity saving throw,
      taking 10d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
      successful one.</p><p>The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus
      breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points per 10-foot section, and it has
      Immunity to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire
      damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 Hit Points destroys it and
      leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall
      occupied.</p><p>A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the
      first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold
      damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The damage
      the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6 and the damage from
      passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6 for each spell
      slot level above 6.</p>
