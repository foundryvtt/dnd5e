      <p>You launch a lightning bolt toward a target you can see within range.
      Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets
      of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target.
      A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of
      the bolts.</p><p>Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8
      Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> One
      additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for each
      spell slot level above 6.</p>
