      <p>You create a wall of whirling blades made of magical energy. The wall
      appears within range and lasts for the duration. You make a straight wall
      up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up
      to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides
      Three-Quarters Cover, and its space is Difficult Terrain.</p><p>Any
      creature in the wall's space makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10
      Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
      A creature also makes that save if it enters the wall's space or ends it
      turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.</p>
