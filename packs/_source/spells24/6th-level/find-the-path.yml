    value: >-
      <p>You magically sense the most direct physical route to a location you
      name. You must be familiar with the location, and the spell fails if you
      name a destination on another plane of existence, a moving destination
      (such as a mobile fortress), or an unspecific destination (such as "a
      green dragon's lair").</p><p>For the duration, as long as you are on the
      same plane of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in
      what direction it lies. Whenever you face a choice of paths along the way
      there, you know which path is the most direct.</p>
