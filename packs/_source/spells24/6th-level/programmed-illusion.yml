    value: >-
      <p>You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon within range that activates when a specific trigger occurs. The
      illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot
      Cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and
      what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5
      minutes.</p><p>When the trigger you specify occurs, the illusion springs
      into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion
      finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes,
      after which the illusion can be activated again.</p><p>The trigger can be
      as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual
      or audible phenomena that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example,
      you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who
      attempt to open a trapped door.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image
      reveals it to be illusory, since things can pass through it. A creature
      that takes the Study action to examine the image can determine that it is
      an illusion with a successful [[/check ability=int skill=inv
      dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against your spell save DC. If a creature
      discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the
      image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.</p>
