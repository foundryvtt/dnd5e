    value: >-
      <p>You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000
      square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the
      duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as
      those created by the <em>Gate</em> spell, to enter the area. The spell
      proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures
      from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane,
      the Feywild, the Shadowfell, or the
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplPlaneShift]{Plane
      Shift}</em> spell.</p><p>In addition, the spell damages types of creatures
      that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following:
      Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a
      creature of a chosen type enters the spell's area for the first time on a
      turn or ends its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 Radiant or Necrotic
      damage (your choice when you cast this spell).</p><p>You can designate a
      password when you cast the spell. A creature that speaks the password as
      it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.</p><p>The spell's area
      can't overlap with the area of another <em>Forbiddance</em> spell. If you
      cast <em>Forbiddance</em> every day for 30 days in the same location, the
      spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the Material components are
      consumed on the last casting.</p>
