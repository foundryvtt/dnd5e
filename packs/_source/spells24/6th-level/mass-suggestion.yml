      <p>You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to
      twelve or fewer creatures you can see within range that can hear and
      understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve
      anything that would obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their
      allies. For example, you could say, "Walk to the village down that road,
      and help the villagers there harvest crops until sunset." Or you could
      say, "Now is not the time for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop
      in an hour."</p><p>Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
      have the &amp;Reference[Charmed apply=false] condition for the duration or
      until you or your allies deal damage to the target. Each Charmed target
      pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity
      can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be
      completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for a target upon completing
      it.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The duration
      is longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30 days), or 9 (366
      days).</p>
