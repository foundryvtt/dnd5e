    value: >-
      <p>You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume
      gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this
      cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can hover; it has
      Immunity to the Prone condition; and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning,
      Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this
      form are the &amp;Reference[Dash] action or a Magic action to begin
      reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the
      target has the &amp;Reference[Stunned apply=false] condition. Until the
      spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a
      Magic action followed by a 1-minute transformation.</p><p>If a target is
      in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet
      per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't
      land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.</p>
