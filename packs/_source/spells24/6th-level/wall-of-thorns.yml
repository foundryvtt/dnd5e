name: Wall of Thorns

  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns.
      The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the
      duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high,
      and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20
      feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.</p><p>When the
      wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw,
      taking 7d8 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
      successful one.</p><p>A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly
      and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must
      spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters a
      space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes a
      Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or
      half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only
      once per turn.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong>
      Both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each spell slot level above
      6.</p>
