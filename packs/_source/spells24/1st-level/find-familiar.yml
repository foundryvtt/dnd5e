    value: >-
      <p>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form
      you choose: <strong>Bat</strong>, <strong>Cat</strong>,
      <strong>Frog</strong>, <strong>Hawk</strong>, <strong>Lizard</strong>,
      <strong>Octopus</strong>, <strong>Owl</strong>, <strong>Rat</strong>,
      <strong>Raven</strong>, <strong>Spider</strong>, <strong>Weasel</strong>,
      or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an
      unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the
      chosen form (see appendix B), though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend
      (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you,
      but it obeys your commands.</p><p><strong>Telepathic Connection.</strong>
      While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it
      telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the
      familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
      gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.</p><p>Finally, when you
      cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch.
      Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction
      to deliver the touch when you cast the
      spell.</p><p><strong>Combat.</strong> The familiar is an ally to you and
      your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A
      familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as
      normal.</p><p><strong>Disappearance of the Familiar.</strong> When the
      familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast
      this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the
      familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever.
      As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to
      reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the
      familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it
      leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or
      carrying.</p><p><strong>One Familiar Only.</strong> You can't have more
      than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a
      familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.</p>
