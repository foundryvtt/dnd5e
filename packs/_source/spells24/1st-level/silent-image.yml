    value: >-
      <p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot Cube. The image appears at a
      spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual;
      it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.</p><p>As a
      Magic action, you can cause the image to move to any spot within range. As
      the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its
      movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an
      image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it
      appears to be walking.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals
      it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A creature that
      takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an
      illusion with a successful [[/check ability=int skill=inv
      dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against your spell save DC. If a creature
      discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the
      image.</p>
