    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates an Invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that
      performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant
      springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range.
      It has AC 10, 1 Hit Point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it
      drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends.</p><p>Once on each of your turns as
      a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet
      and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a
      human could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding
      clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. Once you give
      the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability
      until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.</p><p>If
      you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60
      feet away from you, the spell ends.</p>
