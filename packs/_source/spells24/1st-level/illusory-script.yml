    value: >-
      <p>You write on parchment, paper, or another suitable material and imbue
      it with an illusion that lasts for the duration. To you and any creatures
      you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, seems
      to be written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when
      you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were
      written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible.
      Alternatively, the illusion can alter the meaning, handwriting, and
      language of the text, though the language must be one you know.</p><p>If
      the spell is dispelled, the original script and the illusion both
      disappear.</p><p>A creature that has &amp;Reference[truesight] can read
      the hidden message.</p>
