      <p>One creature of your choice that you can see within range makes a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has the &amp;Reference[prone
      apply=false] and &amp;Reference[incapacitated apply=false] conditions for
      the duration. During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it's capable
      of laughter, and it can't end the Prone condition on itself.</p><p>At the
      end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another
      [[/save ability=wis dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] saving throw. The target has
      Advantage on the save if the save is triggered by damage. On a successful
      save, the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell
      Slot.</strong> You can target one additional creature for each spell slot
