      <p>You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range.
      The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on
      its next turn. Choose the command from these
      options:</p><p><strong>Approach.</strong> The target moves toward you by
      the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5
      feet of you.</p><p><strong>Drop.</strong> The target drops whatever it is
      holding and then ends its turn.</p><p><strong>Flee.</strong> The target
      spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available
      means.</p><p><strong>Grovel.</strong> The target has the Prone condition
      and then ends its turn.</p><p><strong>Halt.</strong> On its turn, the
      target doesn't move and takes no action or Bonus
      Action.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> You can
      affect one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.</p>
