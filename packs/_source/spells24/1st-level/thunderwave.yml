      <p>You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot
      Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
      save, a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from
      you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage
      only.</p><p>In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the
      Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible
      within 300 feet.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong>
      The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.</p>
