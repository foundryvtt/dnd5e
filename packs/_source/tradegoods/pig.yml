      <p>A creature for medium- or larger area farmers, pigs breed relatively
      quickly and are sturdy creatures that provide all manner of cooking
      possibilities for the enterprizing cook, foremost of which is of course
      bacon. Their skin can also be used as a cheaper leather, but it is less
      tear-resistant compared to lamb or goat. Pigs are also the source of
      lard.</p>

      <p>Most pigs weigh between 250 and 270 pounds at slaughter as it gives
      optimal retail cuts and medium fat covering.</p>
