      <p>Often the workhorse of the metalworker, iron is appreciated for its
      relative abundence and ease of attainment. Surface iron can be found from
      fallen meteors and xenoliths, but is much more commonly mined underground.
      However, care must be given otherwise rust will take its toll.</p>
