      <p>A square yard of cotton of average quality and weight. Used for all
      many of items and clothing.</p>

      <p>Far lighter, more comfortable, and easier to work with than canvas;
      however, the comparatively more delicate crop means it is accordingly more
      expensive and potentially harder to come by.</p>
