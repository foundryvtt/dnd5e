      <p>Coveted by advanced shipwrights, alchemists, certain jewelers, and
      chefs alike, copper is commonly surface mined but underground mining
      exists when surface sources have been depleted or unable to be
      located.</p>

      <p>Although it can be used for armor, it is far better mixed with tin to
      make the much more superior bronze alloy for military needs.</p>
