      <p>Likely to be one of the most highly prized ingredients in the world,
      saffron is so expensive because it is so labor-intensive to produce. Made
      from the Crocus sativus, or more commonly the "saffron crocus", it takes
      80,000 crocus flowers to produce 1 pound of saffron.By weight, it is worth
      more than gold. Treasured by the most discerning of cooks and apothecaries
      for its flavoring and purported health benefits.</p>
