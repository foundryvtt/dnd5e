      <p>Gold is the king of currency for many civilizations. Usually more
      common than the likes of platinum, but nowhere near as common as other
      metals like iron, it occupies a sweet spot in rarity and
      unreactiveness.</p>

      <p>Unlike silver, gold can be found more easily on the surface. Both
      surface and underground mining can be extremely profitable. Gold rushes
      can and have been a source a great happiness and huge tragedy.</p>
