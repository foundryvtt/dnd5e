    value: >-
      <p>A useful creature for small-area farmers and highland dwellers, though
      not quite as nimble as goats, they have the valuable ability to be sheared
      every year, giving people a source of clothing, rugs, and throws for beds
      and chairs. Their larger size also means they are more valuable for
      slaughter.</p>

      <p>Depending on the breed, adult sheep can range from 100 pounds all the
      way up to 350 pounds.</p>
