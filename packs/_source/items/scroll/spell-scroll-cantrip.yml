      <p>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical
      cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the
      scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components.
      Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the
      scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. Once the spell is cast,
      the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is
      interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p>

      <p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than
      you can normally cast, you must make a DC 10 ability check using your
      spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. On a
      failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other
      effect.</p>

      <p>The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving
      throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity.</p>

      <p><strong>Save DC</strong>: 13<br /><strong>Attack Bonus</strong>:
      +5.</p>
