      <p><em>(Requires attunement)</em></p>

      <p>While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command
      word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1
      minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within
      that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing
      through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common
      metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the
      vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must
      succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of
      exhaustion.</p>
