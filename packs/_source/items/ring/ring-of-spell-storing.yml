      <p>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned
      wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a
      time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by
      the GM.</p>

      <p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by
      touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other
      than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell
      is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell
      determines how much space it uses.</p>

      <p>While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell
      uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting
      ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast
      the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing
      up space.</p>
