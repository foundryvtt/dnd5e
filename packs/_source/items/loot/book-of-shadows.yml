      <p>A grimoire given to you by your patron. Choose three cantrips from any
      class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the
      book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't
      count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the
      warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. </p>

      <p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to
      receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed
      during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
      turns to ash when you die.</p>
