      <p><em>Wondrous item, (requires attunement)</em></p>

      <p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While
      you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent
      toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.</p>

      <p>The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can
      use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.8ihbbjkaOFTPbI73]{Swarm of Rats}
      with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a
      mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If
      there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called
      swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't
      under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily
      at dawn.</p>

      <p>Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control
      comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make
      a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the
      contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the
      pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is
      swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions
      for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A
      friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly
      swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly
      swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over
      that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be
      swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.</p>
