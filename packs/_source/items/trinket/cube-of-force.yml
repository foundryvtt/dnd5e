      <p><em>Wondrous item, (requires attunement)</em></p>

      <p>This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on
      it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains
      1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

      <p>You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a
      number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force
      Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has
      insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of
      invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side.
      The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute,
      until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs
      out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a
      different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges,
      resetting the duration.</p>

      <p>If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid
      object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that
      object as long as the barrier remains.</p>
