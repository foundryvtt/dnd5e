      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak
      the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60
      feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than
      the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw
      or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask
      before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature
      remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature
      at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat,
      or drink and doesn't age.</p>

      <p>You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the
      creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your
      companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you
      give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its
      death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the
      duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and
      alignment.</p>

      <p>An @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{Identify} spell
      reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine
      the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might
      already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly from
      the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables.RollTable.JDtZNDaAirupdm2O]{Iron Flask}
      table.
