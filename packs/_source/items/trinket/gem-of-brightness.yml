      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an
      action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following
      effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a
      30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect
      doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat
      the command word or until you use another function of the gem.</li>

      <li>The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a
      brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you.
      The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become
      blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
      of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>

      <li>The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare
      with blinding light in a 30- foot cone originating from it. Each creature
      in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with
      the second command word.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a
      nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.</p>
