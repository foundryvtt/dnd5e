      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane
      broom until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then
      hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of
      50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30
      feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you
      land.</p>

      <p>You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile
      of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar
      with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another
      command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.</p>
