      <p>Typically found in [[/r 1d4]] pots inside a fine wooden box with a
      brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create
      three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint
      flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its
      image.</p>

      <p>Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a
      surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such
      as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons—that are up to
      10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.</p>

      <p>When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted
      becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates
      an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on
      a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of
      objects you create.</p>

      <p>Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If
      you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of
      gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made
      from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p>

      <p>If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy
      appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm
      to anything.</p>
