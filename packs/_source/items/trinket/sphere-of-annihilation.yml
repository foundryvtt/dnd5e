      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering
      in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.</p>

      <p>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that
      passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is
      susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the
      sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly
      engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.</p>

      <p>The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within
      60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25
      Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one
      direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your
      Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10
      feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on
      a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force
      damage.</p>

      <p>If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's
      control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other
      creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains
      control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.</p>

      <p>If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that
      created by the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV]{Gate}
      spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole,
      the GM determines randomly what happens, using the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables.RollTable.hHR0Zw75o9PXYl4c]{Sphere of
      Annihilation} table.</p>
