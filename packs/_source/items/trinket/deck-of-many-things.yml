      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards
      made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only
      thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.</p>

      <p>Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to
      draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing
      cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have
      no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic
      takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the
      previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number
      of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.</p>

      <p>Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the
      Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to
      draw the same card twice.</p>

      <p>*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards</p>

      <p><strong>Balance</strong>. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration,
      causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes
      evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has
      no effect on you.</p>

      <p><strong>Comet</strong>. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile
      monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points
      enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Donjon</strong>. You disappear and become entombed in a state
      of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were
      wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you
      disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from
      the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} can reveal the
      location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>

      <p><strong>Euryale</strong>. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You
      take a âˆ’2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or
      the magic of <strong>The Fates</strong> card can end this curse.</p>

      <p><strong>The Fates</strong>. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew,
      allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can
      use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time
      before you die.</p>

      <p><strong>Flames</strong>. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil
      seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before
      attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil
      dies.</p>

      <p><strong>Fool</strong>. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw
      from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If
      losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an
      amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>

      <p><strong>Gem</strong>. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each
      or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Idiot</strong>. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1
      (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your
      declared draws.</p>

      <p><strong>Jester</strong>. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two
      additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>

      <p><strong>Key</strong>. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are
      proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.</p>

      <p><strong>Knight</strong>. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter
      who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of
      the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the
      fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>

      <p><strong>Moon</strong>. You are granted the ability to cast the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell 1d3
      times.</p>

      <p><strong>Rogue</strong>. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice
      becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known
      until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell or divine
      intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>

      <p><strong>Ruin</strong>. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other
      than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses,
      buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the
      least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this
      card also disappears.</p>

      <p><strong>Skull</strong>. You summon an avatar of death - a ghostly
      humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral
      scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and
      attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The
      avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it
      disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar
      of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to
      life.</p>

      <p><strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>. The avatar can move through
      other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5
      (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.<br
      /><strong>Turning Immunity</strong>. The avatar is immune to features that
      turn undead.</p>

      <h4 id="actions">Actions</h4>

      <p><strong>Reaping Scythe</strong>. The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe
      through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing
      damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.</p>

      <p> </p>

      <p><strong>Star</strong>. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The
      score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.</p>

      <p><strong>Sun</strong>. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which
      the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.</p>

      <p><strong>Talons</strong>. Every magic item you wear or carry
      disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do
      vanish.</p>

      <p><strong>Throne</strong>. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill,
      and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In
      addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the
      world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you
      must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.</p>

      <p><strong>Vizier</strong>. At any time you choose within one year of
      drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally
      receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the
      answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other
      words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.</p>

      <p><strong>The Void</strong>. This black card spells disaster. Your soul
      is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's
      choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is
      trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} spell can't
      restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that
      holds it. You draw no more cards.</p>
