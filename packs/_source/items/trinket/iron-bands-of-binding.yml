      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1
      pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the
      sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As
      the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal
      bands.</p>

      <p>Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity
      modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained
      until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release
      it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and
      become a sphere once more.</p>

      <p>A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a
      DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is
      destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any
      further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours
      have elapsed.</p>

      <p>Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next
      dawn.</p>
