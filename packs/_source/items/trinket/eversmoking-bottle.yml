      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>Smoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which
      weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of
      thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud's
      area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within
      the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum
      radius of 120 feet.</p>

      <p>The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle
      requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is
      closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20
      miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong
      wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.</p>
