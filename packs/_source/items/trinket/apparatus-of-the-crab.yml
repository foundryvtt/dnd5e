      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p><p>This item first appears to be a Large
      sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch,
      which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation)
      check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel,
      allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are
      set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move
      either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms
      to resemble a giant lobster.</p><p>The Apparatus of the Crab is a Large
      object with the following statistics:</p><p><strong>AC</strong>: 20<br
      /><strong>Hit Points</strong>: 200<br /><strong>Speed</strong>: 30 ft.,
      swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)<br
      /><strong>Damage Immunities</strong>: poison, psychic</p><p>To be used as
      a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch
      is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment
      holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of
      breathing creatures inside.</p><p>The apparatus floats on water. It can
      also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes
      2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p><p>A creature in the
      compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's
      levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral
      position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as show in the
      Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.</p><table
