      <p>While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged
      weapon attacks.</p>

      <p><strong>Curse</strong>. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses
      you until you are targeted by the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse} spell
      or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you.
      Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of
      you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.</p>
