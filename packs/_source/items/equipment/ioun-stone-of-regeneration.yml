      <p><em>Wondrous item, (requires attunement)</em></p>

      <p>An Ioun Stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy
      revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a
      distinct combination of shape and color.</p>

      <p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the
      stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to
      you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the
      stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll
      against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can
      use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>

      <p>A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is
      considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your
      head.</p>

      <p><strong>Stone of Regeneration</strong>. You regain 15 hit points at the
      end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that
      you have at least 1 hit point.</p>
