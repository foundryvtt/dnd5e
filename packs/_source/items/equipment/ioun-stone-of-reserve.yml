      <p><em>Wondrous item, (requires attunement)</em></p>

      <p>An Ioun Stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy
      revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a
      distinct combination of shape and color.</p>

      <p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the
      stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to
      you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the
      stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll
      against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can
      use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>

      <p>A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is
      considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your
      head.</p>

      <p><strong>Stone of Reserve</strong>. This vibrant purple prism stores
      spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store
      up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1
      levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>

      <p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone
      by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than
      to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is
      expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell
      determines how much space it uses.</p>

      <p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it.
      The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and
      spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as
      if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored
      in it, freeing up space.</p>
