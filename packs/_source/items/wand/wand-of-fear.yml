      <p><em>Wand (requires attunement)</em></p><p>This wand has 7 charges for
      the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at
      dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand
      crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p><p><strong>Command</strong>.
      While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and
      command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.arzCrMRgcNiQuh43]{Command} spell (save
      DC 15).</p><p><strong>Cone of Fear</strong>. While holding the wand, you
      can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the wand's tip to emit a
      60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a
      DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become &amp;reference[frightened] of you for
      1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its
      turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't
      willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take
      reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to
      escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it
      can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its
      turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself
      on a success.</p>
