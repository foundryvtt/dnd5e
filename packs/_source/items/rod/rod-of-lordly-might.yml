      <p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that
      grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has
      properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row
      along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>

      <p><strong>Six Buttons</strong>. You can press one of the rod's six
      buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a
      different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the
      rod to revert to its normal form.</p>

      <p>If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a flame tongue,
      as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.</p>

      <p>If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds
      down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into
      a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
      with it.</p>

      <p>If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds
      down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle
      lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that
      grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>

      <p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a
      climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as
      granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole.
      Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart,
      forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or
      lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>

      <p>If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a
      handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks
      made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>

      <p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in
      its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this
      function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The
      rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground
      or your height above it.</p>

      <p><strong>Drain Life</strong>. When you hit a creature with a melee
      attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17
      Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6
      necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that
      necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next
      dawn.</p>

      <p><strong>Paralyze</strong>. When you hit a creature with a melee attack
      using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving
      throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can
      repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
      on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

      <p><strong>Terrify</strong>. While holding the rod, you can use an action
      to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1
      minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
      of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property
      can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
