      <p><em>(Requires attunement)</em></p><p>While holding this rod, you can
      use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not
      with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the
      spell's energy not the spell itself - is stored in the rod. The energy has
      the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store
      up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod
      absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by
      a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that
      spell.</p><p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels
      of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how
      many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p><p>If you are a
      spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into
      spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell
      slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a
      maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots,
      but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels
      stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.</p><p>A newly found rod has
      1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer
      absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes
      nonmagical.</p><section class="secret foundry-note"
      id="secret-4moLuVa8eSuTndZO"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>The
      rod currently has the maximum 10 charges for a newly found rod. Adjust as
      required.</p></section>
