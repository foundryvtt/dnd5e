      <p>A tiny box or other container holding a fragment of a precious relic,
      saint, or other historical figure that dedicated their life to walk the
      path of a true believer. A deity imbues the bearer of this artifact with
      the ability to call forth their power and in doing so spread the faith
      once more.</p>

      <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong>. A cleric or paladin can use a holy
      symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster
      must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p>
