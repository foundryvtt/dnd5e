      <p>Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you
      can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or
      throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack
      against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised
      weapon.</p>

      <p>On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire
      damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an
      additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask
      of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the
      surface is level.</p>

      <p>If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any
      creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can
      take this damage only once per turn.</p>
