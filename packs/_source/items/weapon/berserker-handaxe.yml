      <p><em>(Requires attunement)</em></p>

      <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
      weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point
      maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.</p>

      <p><strong>Curse</strong>. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it
      extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling
      to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have
      disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no
      foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.</p>

      <p>Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your
      possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk.
      While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature
      nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the
      Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next
      nearest creature after you fell your current target.</p>

      <p>If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You
      are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of
      you that you can see or hear.</p>
