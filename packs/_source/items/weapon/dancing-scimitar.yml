      <p>You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and
      speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies
      up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of
      it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage
      rolls.</p>

      <p>While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly
      up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same
      bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet
      of it.</p>

      <p>After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30
      feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls
      to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you,
      it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also
      ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from
      it.</p>
