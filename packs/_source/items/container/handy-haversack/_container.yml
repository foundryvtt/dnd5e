      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which
      is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of
      material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch
      can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always
      weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p>

      <p>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for
      interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires
      you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific
      item, the item is always magically on top.</p>

      <p>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp
      object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If
      the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an
      artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned
      inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be
      put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed
      within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after
      which time it begins to suffocate.</p>

      <p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag
      of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items
      and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one
      item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate
      is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral
      Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be
      reopened.</p>
