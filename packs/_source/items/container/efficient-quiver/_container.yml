      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional
      space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing
      more than 2 pounds.</p>

      <p>The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar
      objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar
      objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as
      bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.</p>

      <p>You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular
      quiver or scabbard.</p>
