      <p><em>Wondrous item</em></p>

      <p>This bag superficially resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding
      orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside
      out closes the orifice.</p>

      <p>The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is
      placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag
      is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in
      the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent
      chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the
      bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength
      check.</p>

      <p>Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a
      creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it
      isn't pulled inside the bag first).</p>

      <p>Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body
      destroyed.</p>

      <p>Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot
      of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects
      inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM
      determines the time and plane.</p>

      <p>If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained
      within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.</p>
