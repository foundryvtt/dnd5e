          <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWish000000]{Wish}</em>
          spell. If the [[lookup @name lowercase]] knows it, the [[lookup @name

          communicates a wish in a way the [[lookup @name lowercase]] can
          understand. If the [[lookup @name lowercase]] casts the spell for the
          creature, the [[lookup @name lowercase]] suffers none of the spell's
          stress. Once the [[lookup @name lowercase]] has cast it three times,
          the [[lookup @name lowercase]] can't do so again for 365 days.</p>

        value: >-
          <p><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply
          speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of
          this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you
          use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that
          spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes
          effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following
          effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You
          create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item.
          The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it
          appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the
          ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and
          up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and
          you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em>
          spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten
          creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you
          choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell
          Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity
          to a single spell or other magical effect for 8
          hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your
          feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the
          benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You
          can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other
          feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single
          recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last
          round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to
          accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could
          undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can
          force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you
          choose whether to use the reroll or the original
          roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for
          something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state
          your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great
          latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the
          wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell
          might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in
          part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how
          you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead
          might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no
          longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly,
          wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly
          transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your
          wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole
          community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes.
          If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might
          instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the
          wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse
          itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any
          way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her
          head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em>
          to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens
          you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you
          finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that
          spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In
          addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of
          those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light
          activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally,
          there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to
          cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>

          <p>You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of fresh water on the
          ground or in containers within range—both useful in fending off the
          hazards of malnutrition and dehydration. The food is bland but
          nourishing and looks like a food of your choice, and the water is
          clean. The food spoils after 24 hours if uneaten.</p>

          <p>This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand
          any spoken or signed language that it hears or sees. Moreover, when
          the target communicates by speaking or signing, any creature that
          knows at least one language can understand it if that creature can
          hear the speech or see the signing.</p>

          <p>You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range
          assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud.
          While in this cloud form, a target has a Fly Speed of 300 feet and can
          hover; it has Immunity to the Prone condition; and it has Resistance
          to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a
          target can take in this form are the &amp;Reference[Dash] action or a
          Magic action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1
          minute, during which the target has the &amp;Reference[Stunned
          apply=false] condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to
          cloud form, which also requires a Magic action followed by a 1-minute
          transformation.</p><p>If a target is in cloud form and flying when the
          effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until
          it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it
          falls the remaining distance.</p>

          <p>You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create an
          object within range. It is either an object of vegetable matter (soft
          goods, rope, wood, and the like) or mineral matter (stone, crystal,
          metal, and the like). The object must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube,
          and the object must be of a form and material that you have
          seen.</p><p>The spell's duration depends on the object's material, as
          shown in the Materials table. If the object is composed of multiple
          materials, use the shortest duration. Using any object created by this
          spell as another spell's Material component causes the other spell to
          fail.</p><table><thead><tr><td>Material</td><td>Duration</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Vegetable

          <p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other
          visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image
          appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the
          duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature
          appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause
          conditions.</p><p>If you are within range of the illusion, you can
          take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot
          within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its
          appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For
          example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can
          alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can
          cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even
          making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p><p>Physical
          interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things
          can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine
          the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
          [[/check ability=int skill=inv dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against
          your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it
          is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory
          qualities become faint to the creature.</p><p><strong>Using a
          Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The spell lasts until dispelled,
          without requiring Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell
          slot.</p>
