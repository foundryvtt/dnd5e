          communicates a wish in a way the [[lookup @name lowercase]] can
          understand. If the [[lookup @name lowercase]] casts the spell for the

        value: >-
          <p><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply
          speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of
          this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you
          use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that
          spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes
          effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following
          effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You
          create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item.
          The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it
          appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the
          ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and
          up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and
          you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em>
          spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten
          creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you
          choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell
          Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity
          to a single spell or other magical effect for 8
          hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your
          feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the
          benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You
          can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other
          feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single
          recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last
          round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to
          accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could
          undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can
          force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you
          choose whether to use the reroll or the original
          roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for
          something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state
          your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great
          latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the
          wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell
          might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in
          part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how
          you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead
          might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no
          longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly,
          wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly
          transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your
          wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole
          community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes.
          If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might
          instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the
          wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse
          itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any
          way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her
          head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em>
          to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens
          you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you
          finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that
          spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In
          addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of
          those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light
          activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally,
          there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to
          cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>

          <p>For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within
          30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic
          action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in
          the area that bears the magic, and if an effect was created by a
          spell, you learn the spell's school of magic.</p><p>The spell is
          blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin
          sheet of lead.</p>

          <p>You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following
          effects within range.</p><p><strong>Beckon Air.</strong> You create a
          breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and
          close open doors and shutters, all in a 5-foot Cube. Doors and
          shutters being held open by someone or something aren't
          affected.</p><p><strong>Beckon Earth.</strong> You create a thin
          shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area,
          or you cause a single word to appear in your handwriting in a patch of
          dirt or sand.</p><p><strong>Beckon Fire.</strong> You create a thin
          cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot Cube.
          You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles,
          torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke's scent lingers for 1
          minute.</p><p><strong>Beckon Water.</strong> You create a spray of
          cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot Cube.
          Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open
          container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1
          minute.</p><p><strong>Sculpt Element.</strong> You cause dirt, sand,
          fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot Cube to assume a
          crude shape (such as that of a creature) for 1 hour.</p>

          <p>A willing creature you touch shape-shifts, along with everything
          it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The
          spell ends on the target if it drops to 0 Hit Points or if it takes a
          Magic action to end the spell on itself.</p><p>While in this form, the
          target's only method of movement is a Fly Speed of 10 feet, and it can
          hover. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature.
          The target has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing
          damage; it has Immunity to the &amp;Reference[prone apply=false]
          condition; and it has Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and
          Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through narrow
          openings, but it treats liquids as though they were solid
          surfaces.</p><p>The target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any
          objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or
          otherwise interacted with. Finally, the target can't attack or cast
          spells.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> You
          can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above
          3.</p>

          <p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other
          visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image
          appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the
          duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature
          appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause
          conditions.</p><p>If you are within range of the illusion, you can
          take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot
          within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its
          appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For
          example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can
          alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can
          cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even
          making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p><p>Physical
          interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things
          can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine
          the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
          [[/check ability=int skill=inv dc=@attributes.spell.dc]] check against
          your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it
          is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory
          qualities become faint to the creature.</p><p><strong>Using a
          Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The spell lasts until dispelled,
          without requiring Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell
          slot.</p>

        value: >-
          <p>You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can
          make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a
          ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick.
          The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.</p><p>When the wall
          appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw,
          taking 5d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
          successful one.</p><p>One side of the wall, selected by you when you
          cast this spell, deals 5d8 Fire damage to each creature that ends its
          turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes
          the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn
          or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no
          damage.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The
          damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.</p>
