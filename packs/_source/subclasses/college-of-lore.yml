      <p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things,
      collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes
      and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
      compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold
      audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members
      might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from
      their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the
      king.</p>

      <p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not
      in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who
      keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather
      be honest than politic.</p>

      <p>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual
      colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore
      with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where
      they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
      figures of authority.</p>
