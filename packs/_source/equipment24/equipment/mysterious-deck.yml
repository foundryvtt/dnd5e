      <div><p><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary</em></p></div><p>Usually found in a
      box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or
      vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some
      have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Mysterious Deck table
      when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.</p><p>Before you draw
      a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw
      them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect.
      Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes
      effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous
      draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards
      fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.</p><p>Once a
      card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the
      card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card
      twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if
      that card comes up
      again.)</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmg13CardDeckOfM

      id="secret-89gUJH8GuylznwxV"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>Upon
      discovery, the owner (or GM) should use the <strong>Check Deck
      Size</strong> activity in order to determine the number of cards in the
      deck. The activity will set this item's remaining uses (out of 22)
      according to the number of cards in this deck. Alternatively, the GM may
      set this item's <em>max uses</em> based on the deck size.</p><p>In either
      case, both the <strong>Check Deck Size</strong> activity and the Embedded
      RollTable link corresponding to the unused deck size can be deleted after
      this determination has been made.</p></section>
