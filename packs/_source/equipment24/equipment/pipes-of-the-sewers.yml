      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>While
      these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats and giant rats are
      Indifferent toward you and won't attack you unless you threaten or harm
      them.</p><p>The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily
      at dawn. If you play the pipes as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus
      Action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one
      <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSwarmOfRats000]{Swarm of
      Rats}</strong> with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a
      mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If
      there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called
      swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't
      under your control otherwise.</p><p>Whenever a <strong>Swarm of
      Rats</strong> that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30
      feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a DC 15
      Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it
      normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24
      hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and
      becomes Friendly to you and your allies for as long as you continue to
      play the pipes each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm obeys your
      commands. If you issue no commands to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself
      but otherwise takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn more
      than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the
      swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music
      for the next 24 hours.</p>
