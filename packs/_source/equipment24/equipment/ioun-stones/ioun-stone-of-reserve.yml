      <p><em>See: @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgIounStone0000]{Ioun
      Stone}</em></p><p>When you take a Magic action to toss an <em>Ioun
      Stone</em> into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3
      feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to
      three <em>Ioun Stones</em> orbiting your head at the same time.</p><p>As a
      Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of <em>Ioun Stones</em>
      orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an <em>Ioun Stone</em> ends
      while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped
      it.</p><p>This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding
      them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a
      time. When found, it contains [[/r 1d4#Spell Levels]] levels of stored
      spells chosen by the DM.</p><p>Any creature can cast a spell of level 1
      through 4 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell
      has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't
      hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the
      slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p><p>While
      this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The
      spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and
      spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if
      you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in
      it, freeing up space.</p>
