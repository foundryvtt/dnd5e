      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>While you
      wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical
      surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a
      Climb Speed equal to your Speed. However, the slippers don't allow you to
      move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or
      oil.</p>
