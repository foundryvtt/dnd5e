    value: >-
      <div><p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p></div><p>As
      a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch adamantine statuette on the
      ground and, using a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a square
      adamantine tower. Repeating the command word causes the tower to revert to
      statuette form, which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in
      the area where the tower appears is pushed to an unoccupied space outside
      but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or
      carried are also pushed clear of the tower.</p><p>The tower is 20 feet on
      a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement
      atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder,
      staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting them. This ladder, staircase,
      or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower
      has a single door at ground level on the side facing you. The door opens
      only at your command, which you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune
      to the <em>Knock</em> spell and similar magic.</p><p>Magic prevents the
      tower from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have
      AC 20; HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage
      except that which is dealt by siege equipment; and Resistance to all other
      damage. Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form doesn't repair
      damage to the tower. Only a
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplWish000000]{Wish}</em>
      spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a
      spell of level 8 or lower). Each casting of <em>Wish</em> causes the tower
      to regain all its Hit Points.</p>
