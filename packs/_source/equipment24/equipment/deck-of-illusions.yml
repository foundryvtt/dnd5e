      <div><p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</em></p></div><p>This box contains a
      set of cards. A full deck has 34 cards: 32 depicting specific creatures
      and two with a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually
      missing [[/r 1d20 âˆ’ 1#Missing cards]] cards.</p><p>The magic of the deck
      functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic
      action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground
      at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature,
      determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the
      thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by
      the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that
      it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature
      and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30
      feet of its card.</p><p>Any physical interaction with the illusory
      creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A
      creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory
      creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful [[/check
      ability=int skill=inv dc=15 format=long]]. The illusion lasts until its
      card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDispelMagi]{Dispel
      Magic}</em> spell or a similar effect). When the illusion ends, the image
      on its card disappears, and that card can't be used
      again.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgDeckOfIllusio
      rollable]</p><section class="secret"
      id="secret-dg7rbpSc8GfB0AXm"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>Due to
      the single-use nature of each card, it is recommended to import a copy of
      the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgDeckOfIllusio]{table} and
      insert its UUID into the @Embed enricher, above.</p><p>Additionally, when
      first obtained, the GM or player should use the <strong>Count Number of
      Cards</strong> activity to randomly determine the total number of cards
      remaining in the deck. After one use, it may be
      deleted.</p></section><p></p>
