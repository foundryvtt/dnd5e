      <p><em>Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>While holding this
      rod, you can take a Reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you
      and doesn't create an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is
      canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the
      rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. A
      canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast
      it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over
      the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it
      can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't
      store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p><p>When you become attuned
      to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over
      the course of its existence and how many levels of spell energy it
      currently has stored.</p><p>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you
      can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have
      prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or
      lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use the
      stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise cast the spell as
      normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a level 3
      spell slot.</p><p>A newly found rod typically has [[/r 1d10]] levels of
      spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy
      and has no energy remaining becomes
      nonmagical.</p><p><strong>Available:</strong> You can track the amount of
      available energy here.</p><section class="secret"
      id="secret-W3rvR0CLtP9xnxbY"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>This
      item has a max of 50 uses for tracking the total <strong>energy
      absorbed</strong>. You can roll 1d10 and update the expended uses and the
      <strong>Available</strong> energy in the description above as
      desired.</p><p>The <strong>Absorb Spell</strong> activity allows you to
      select the spell level you're absorbing and expends a number of uses. You
      should then manually update the <strong>Available</strong> amount of
      energy in the description above.</p><p>The <strong>Restore Slot</strong>
      activity allows you to restore a spell slot. You should then manually
      update the <strong>Available</strong> amount of energy in the description
      above.</p></section>
