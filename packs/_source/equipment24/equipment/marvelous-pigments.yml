    value: >-
      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare</em></p><p>This fine wooden box contains
      1d4 pots of pigment and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).</p><p>Using
      the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of
      three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors,
      trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all
      confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the
      number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the
      Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you
      leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish,
      and the pot of pigment is wasted.</p><p>When the work is done, all the
      painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on
      a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond.
      Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie
      within the 20-foot Cube.</p><p>No object created by a pot of pigment can
      have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects
      created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of
      greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but
      close inspection reveals they're made from paste, cookies, or some other
      worthless material.</p><p>If you paint a form of energy such as fire or
      lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting,
      doing no harm.</p><section class="secret"
      id="secret-qUNCffT2Tfry1qQt"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>This
      item begins with 4 max uses. The <strong>Determine the Number of
      Pots</strong> activity can be used to determine how many pots remain in
      the box.</p></section>
