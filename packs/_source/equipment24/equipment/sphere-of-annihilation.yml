      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary</em></p><p>This 2-foot-diameter black
      sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a
      magical field surrounding it.</p><p>The sphere obliterates all matter it
      passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the
      exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a <em>Sphere
      of Annihilation</em>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything
      else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by
      it takes 8d10 Force damage.</p><p><em><strong>Controlling the
      Sphere.</strong></em> A <em>Sphere of Annihilation</em> is stationary
      until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere,
      you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
      On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next
      turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses
      control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward
      you in a straight line.</p><p>While in control of the sphere, you can take
      a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to
      a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5
      feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19
      Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A
      creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving
      its possessions behind but no other physical
      remains.</p><p><em><strong>Sphere Interactions.</strong></em> If the
      sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by
      the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGate000000]{Gate} spell) or
      an extradimensional space (such as that within a
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPortableHole0]{Portable Hole}),
      the GM determines randomly what happens using the following
      table.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSphereOfAnnih]</p>
