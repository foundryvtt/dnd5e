      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires
      Attunement)</em></p><p>Roughly marble sized, <em>Ioun Stones</em> are
      named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds.
      Many types of <em>Ioun Stones</em> exist, each type a distinct combination
      of shape and color.</p><p>When you take a Magic action to toss an <em>Ioun
      Stone</em> into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3
      feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to
      three <em>Ioun Stones</em> orbiting your head at the same time.</p><p>Each
      <em>Ioun Stone</em> orbiting your head is considered to be an object you
      are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and
      objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all
      attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.</p><p>As a Utilize
      action, you can seize and stow any number of <em>Ioun Stones</em> orbiting
      your head. If your Attunement to an <em>Ioun Stone</em> ends while it's
      orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped
      it.</p><p>The type of stone determines its rarity and
      effects.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgAbsorptionIou]{Absorption}
      (Very Rare).</strong> While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head,
      you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a
      creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources
      used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of
      spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its
      magic.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgAgilityIounSt]{Agility}
      (Very Rare).</strong> Your Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 20,
      while this deep-red sphere orbits your
      head.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgAwarenessIoun]{Awareness}
      (Rare).</strong> While this dark-blue rhomboid orbits your head, you have
      Advantage on Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception)
      checks.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgFortitudeIoun]{Fortitude}

      20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your
      head.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgGreaterAbsorp]{Greater
      Absorption} (Legendary).</strong> While this marbled lavender and green
      ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of
      level 8 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no
      effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has
      canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its
      magic.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgInsightIounSt]{Insight}
      (Very Rare).</strong> Your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 20,
      while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your
      head.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgIntellectIoun]{Intellect}
      (Very Rare).</strong> Your Intelligence increases by 2, to a maximum of
      20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your
      head.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgLeadershipIou]{Leadership}
      (Very Rare).</strong> Your Charisma increases by 2, to a maximum of 20,
      while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your
      head.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgMasteryIounSt]{Mastery}
      (Legendary).</strong> Your Proficiency Bonus increases by 1 while this
      pale green prism orbits your
      head.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgProtectionIou]{Protection}
      (Rare).</strong> You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while this dusty-rose
      prism orbits your
      head.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgRegnerationIo]{Regeneration}
      (Legendary).</strong> You regain 15 Hit Points at the end of each hour
      this pearly white spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit
      Point.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgReserveIounSt]{Reserve}
      (Rare).</strong> This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it,
      holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of
      spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells
      chosen by the DM.</p><p>Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4
      into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no
      effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the
      spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to
      cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p><p>While this stone
      orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the
      slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of
      the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The
      spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up
      space.</p><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgStrengthIounS]{Strength}
      (Very Rare).</strong> Your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 20,
      while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your

      (Rare).</strong> You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle
      orbits your head.</p>
