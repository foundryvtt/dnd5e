      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare</em></p><p>When this 4-foot-tall,
      2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of
      creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity
      to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It
      shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p><p>If the
      mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it,
      you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It
      remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command
      word to deactivate it.</p><p>Any creature other than you that sees its
      reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must
      succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with
      anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve
      extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes
      the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save
      automatically.</p><p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse
      filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures
      trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat,
      drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic
      that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the
      cell until freed.</p><p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve
      extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped
      creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature
      appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away
      from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed
      and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p><p>While within 5 feet of the
      mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or
      call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in
      the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the
      creature can then communicate.</p><p>In a similar way, you can take a
      Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in
      the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the
      unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from
      it.</p><p>Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a
      <em>Bag of Holding</em>, <em>Portable Hole</em>, or similar item instantly
      destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate
      originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature
      within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it
      to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate
      is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p><section
      id="secret-wD2MAubhr1RWqA6v" class="secret"><p><strong>Foundry
      Note</strong></p><p>This item has a max uses of 12 which can be used to
      track the number of creatures trapped within the mirror. The
      <strong>Add/Free Trapped Creature</strong> activities can be used to
      increment/decrement that number.</p></section>
