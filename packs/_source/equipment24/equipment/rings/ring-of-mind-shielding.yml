      <p><em>Ring, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>While wearing this
      ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your
      thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know
      your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only
      if you allow it.</p><p>You can take a Magic action to cause the ring to
      become imperceptible until you take another Magic action to make it
      perceptible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.</p><p>If you die
      while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a
      soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as
      your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any
      creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic
      communication.</p>
