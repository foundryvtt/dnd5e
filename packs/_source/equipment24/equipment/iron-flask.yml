      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary</em></p><p>While holding this
      brass-stoppered iron flask, you can take a Magic action to target a
      creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask is
      empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one
      you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be
      trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before,
      it has Advantage on the save. Once trapped, a creature remains in the
      flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A
      creature trapped in the flask doesn't age and doesn't need to breathe,
      eat, or drink.</p><p>You can take a Magic action to remove the flask's
      stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys
      your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn't
      know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no
      commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its
      death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions.
      At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its
      normal disposition and alignment.</p><p>An
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplIdentify00]{Identify} spell
      reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine
      the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered <em>Iron
      Flask</em> might already contain a creature chosen by the GM.</p><section
      class="secret" id="secret-LJ4Og6JjdncKvEKV"><p><strong>Foundry
      Note</strong></p><p>This item has one limited use for tracking whether or
      not a creature has been trapped in the flask.</p><p>The <strong>Add
      Trapped Creature</strong> activity expends a usage to indicate it is
      currently full.</p><p>The <strong>Release Trapped Creature</strong>
      activity is a summon activity which restores a usage to indicate it can
      now contain another creature. You can edit the activity, change to the
      "Summon" tab and drag the captured creature's Actor onto the tab so it can
      be summoned later.</p></section>
