      <p>You can douse a creature, object, or space with Oil or use it as fuel,
      as detailed below.</p><p><strong>Dousing a Creature or an Object.</strong>
      When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with
      throwing an Oil flask. Target one creature or object within 20 feet of
      yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus
      your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be covered in oil. If
      the target takes Fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the
      target takes an extra [[/damage 5 type=fire]] damage from burning
      oil.</p><p><strong>Dousing a Space.</strong> You can take the Utilize
      action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-foot-square area
      within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn
      2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage
      to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature
      can take this damage only once per turn.</p><p><strong>Fuel.</strong> Oil
      serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a flask of Oil burns for
      6 hours in a Lamp or Lantern. That duration doesn't need to be
      consecutive; you can extinguish the burning Oil (as a Utilize action) and
      rekindle it again until it has burned for a total of 6 hours.</p>
