      <p><em>Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>While holding
      this Shield, you have Resistance to damage from attacks made with Ranged
      weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This Shield is cursed.
      Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplRemoveCurs]{Remove Curse} spell
      or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you.
      Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet
      of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.</p>
