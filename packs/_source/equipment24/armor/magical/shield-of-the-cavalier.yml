      <p><em>Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>While
      holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus is in
      addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.</p><p>The Shield has the
      following additional properties that you can use while holding
      it.</p><p><em><strong>Forceful Bash</strong></em><strong>.</strong> When
      you take the Attack action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the
      Shield against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your Proficiency
      Bonus and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals
      Force damage to the target equal to 2d6 + 2 plus your Strength modifier,
      and if the target is a creature, you can push it up to 10 feet directly
      away from yourself. If the creature is your size or smaller, you can also
      knock it down, giving it the Prone condition.</p><p><em><strong>Protective
      Field.</strong></em> As a Reaction, when you or an ally you can see within
      5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an
      area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot
      Emanation originating from you. When the Emanation appears, any creatures
      or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest
      unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered
      the Reaction has no effect on creatures and objects inside the Emanation,
      which lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Nothing
      can pass into or out of the Emanation. A creature or object inside the
      Emanation can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside,
      nor can a creature inside the Emanation damage anything outside it. Once
      this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
