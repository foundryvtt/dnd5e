      <p><em>Armor (Studded Leather Armor), Rare</em></p><p>While wearing this
      armor, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. You can also take a Bonus
      Action to cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of
      clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks
      like—including color, style, and accessories—but the armor retains its
      normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this
      property again or doff the armor.</p>
