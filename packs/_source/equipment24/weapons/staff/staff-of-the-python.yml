      <p><em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbafcStaffalsoa]{Staff},
      Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>As a Magic action, you can throw
      this staff so that it lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you,
      causing the staff to become a <strong>Giant Constrictor Snake</strong> in
      that space. The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative
      count, taking its turn immediately after yours.</p><p>On your turn, you
      can mentally command the snake (no action required) if it is within 60
      feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You decide
      what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can
      issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a
      location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself.</p><p>As a
      Bonus Action, you can command the snake to revert to staff form in its
      current space, and you can't use the staff's property again for 1 hour. If
      the snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its staff
      form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to
      staff form before losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.</p>
