      <p><em>Weapon
      (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.phbwepQuartersta]{Quarterstaff}),
      Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p><p>You have a +2 bonus to attack
      rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><p>While holding
      this weapon, you can cause it to emit green Dim Light out to 10 feet,
      either as a Bonus Action or after you roll Initiative, or you can
      extinguish the light as a Bonus Action.</p><p>While holding this weapon,
      you can take a Bonus Action to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch
      rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a
      Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding
      space allows.</p><p>In certain forms, the weapon has the following
      additional properties.</p><p><em><strong>Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff or
      10-Foot Pole Forms Only).</strong></em> While holding this weapon, you
      have Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</p><p><em><strong>Attack
      Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only).</strong></em> When you are hit by an
      attack while holding the weapon, you can take a Reaction to twirl the
      weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your Armor Class against the
      triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't
      use this property again until you finish a Short or Long
      Rest.</p><p><em><strong>Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form
      Only).</strong></em> This weapon has the Thrown property with a normal
      range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make
      a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.</p>
