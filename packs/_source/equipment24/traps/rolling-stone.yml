      <div><p ><em>Deadly Trap (Levels 11–16) or Nuisance Trap (Levels
      17–20)</em></p><p><strong>Trigger:</strong> A creature moves onto a
      pressure plate</p><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until the stone stops
      rolling</p><p>When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure plate, a
      5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released from a secret compartment and
      begins to roll. The stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the
      stone gets a [[/r 1d20 + 8]]{+8} bonus on its Initiative roll.</p><p>On
      its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direction, changing course if
      redirected by an obstacle. The stone can move through creatures' spaces,
      and creatures can move through the stone's space, treating it as
      &amp;Reference[Difficult Terrain]. Whenever the stone enters a creature's
      space for the first time on a turn or a creature enters the stone's space
      while the stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15
      Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Bludgeoning damage and have the
      &amp;Reference[Prone apply=false] condition.</p><p>The stone stops when it
      hits a wall or similar barrier. It can't go around corners, but creative
      dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into nearby passages that allow
      the stone to keep moving.</p><p><em><strong>Detect and
      Disarm.</strong></em> As a Study action, a creature can examine the
      section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a [[/check inv
      15]] check, deducing the pressure plate's function on a successful check.
      Wedging an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate
      prevents the trap from triggering.</p><p><em><strong>Destroy the
      Stone.</strong></em> The stone is a Large object that has AC 17, HP 100, a
      Damage Threshold of 10, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic
      damage.</p><p><em><strong>Slow the Stone.</strong></em> As an action, a
      creature can try to slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength (Athletics)
      check. If the check is successful, the distance the stone moves on its
      turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that distance drops to 0, it stops moving
      and is no longer a threat.</p></div>
