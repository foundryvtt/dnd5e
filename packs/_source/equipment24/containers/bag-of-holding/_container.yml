      <div><p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its
      outside dimensionsâ€”roughly 2 feet square and 4 feet deep on the inside.
      The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 <span
      class="no-break">cubic</span> feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of
      its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize
      action.</p><p>If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed,
      and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned
      inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put
      right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes
      of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures
      inside.</p><p>Placing a <em>Bag of Holding</em> inside an extradimensional
      space created by a
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgHewardsHandyH]{Handy
      Haversack}</em>,
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPortableHole0]{Portable
      Hole}</em>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate
      to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed
      inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on
      the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane.
      The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can't be reopened.</p></div>
