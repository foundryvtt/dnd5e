      <div><p>This bag resembles a
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgBagOfHolding0]{Bag of
      Holding}</em> but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional
      creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.</p><p>The
      extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed
      inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is
      devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the
      bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a [[/r
      1dc#Creature pulled in on a 1, or "Heads"]]{50 percent} chance that the
      creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can take an
      action to try to escape, doing so with a successful [[/check ability=str
      skill=ath dc=15 format=long]]. Another creature can take an action to
      reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful
      [[/check ability=str skill=ath dc=20 format=long]], provided the puller
      isn't pulled inside the bag first. Any creature that starts its turn
      inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p><p>Inanimate objects
      can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material.
      However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits
      them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and
      plane.</p><p>If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything
      contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral
      Plane.</p></div>
