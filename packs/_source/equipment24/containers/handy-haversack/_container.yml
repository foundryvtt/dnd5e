      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em></p><p>This backpack has a central pouch
      and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each
      side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume
      of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material,
      not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5
      pounds, regardless of its contents.</p><p>Retrieving an item from the
      haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When
      you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always
      magically on top.</p><p>If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or
      torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is
      destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always
      turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its
      contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before
      it can be used again.</p><p>Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air
      for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures
      inside.</p><p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space
      created by a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgBagOfHolding0]{Bag
      of Holding},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.equipment24.Item.dmgPortableHole0]{Portable Hole},
      or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the
      Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the
      other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover
      is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral
      Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be
      reopened.</p>
