      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</em></p><p>Each of the quiver's three
      compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver
      to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The
      shortest compartment can hold up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects.
      The midsize compartment holds up to 18 Javelins or similar objects. The
      longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows,
      Quarterstaffs, or Spears.</p><p>You can draw any item the quiver contains
      as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.</p>
