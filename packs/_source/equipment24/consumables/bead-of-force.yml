      <p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em></p><p>This small black sphere measures 3/4
      of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, [[/r 1d4 + 4#Beads
      of Force]] <em>Beads of Force</em> are found together.</p><p>You can take
      a Magic action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a
      10-foot-radius Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature in the
      Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 Force
      damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute.
      Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is
      trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are
      partially within the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere
      until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through
      the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.</p><p>An
      enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to push against the sphere's
      wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's Speed. The sphere can be
      picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of
      the weight of creatures inside.</p>
