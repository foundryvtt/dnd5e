      <p><em>Potion, Very Rare</em></p><p>When you drink this potion, your
      physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each
      time you subsequently drink a Potion of Longevity, there is 10 percent
      cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 + 6 years.</p><p>Suspended
      in this amber liquid is a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still
      beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.</p>
