          <p>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures.
          When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the
          spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can
          see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an
          Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature
          is unaffected.</p><p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the
          creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you
          can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or
          attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe
          deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you
          gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and
          something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries
          over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way,
          the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you
          shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can
          use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by
          your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell
          ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature
          naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is
          particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also
          use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't
          see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration,
          you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can
          penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other
          than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a
          creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak
          any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this
          way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as
          described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within
          range.</p>

          <p>You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and
          other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or
          until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter
          or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change
          your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic
          arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to
          you.</p><p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
          physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat
          to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches
          it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use
          this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who
          reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly
          still in midair.</p><p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature
          can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an
          Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p>

          up to 30 feet each time you use it.</p><p>The hand can't attack,

          <p>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts
          for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an
          action or cast this spell again.</p><p>If you create a sound, its
          volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice,
          someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other
          sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the
          duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before
          the spell ends.</p><p>If you create an image of an object—such as a
          chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a
          5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other
          sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be
          an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p><p>If a creature
          uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can
          determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
          (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
          discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to
          the creature.</p>

          <p>You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must
          make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your

          charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do
          anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly
          acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed
          by you.</p>

          <p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other
          visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image
          appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the
          duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and
          temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create
          sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal
          thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a
          creature (like a troglodyte's stench).</p><p>As long as you are within
          range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to
          move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location,
          you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for
          the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move
          it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
          Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at
          different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for
          example.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
          illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its
          action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with
          a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell

          <p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
          magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear
          and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this
          effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the
          course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself,
          throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously
          harmful act ends the spell.</p><p>The target must make a Wisdom saving
          throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
          to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can
          continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be
          completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes
          what it was asked to do.</p><p>You can also specify conditions that
          will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you
          might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she
          meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the
          activity isn't performed.</p><p>If you or any of your companions
          damage the target, the spell ends.</p>

          <p>You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It
          must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the
          duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting
          it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p><p>While the target is
          charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you
          are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link
          to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action
          required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple
          and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run
          over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the
          order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and
          preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p><p>You can use your
          action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end
          of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and
          doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time
          you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires
          you to use your own reaction as well.</p><p>Each time the target takes
          damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the
          saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher
          Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell
          slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a
          7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour.
          When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is
          concentration, up to 8 hours.</p>

          <p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle
          are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a
          target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the
          Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level
          of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you
          are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive
          in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the
          city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM's
          discretion.</p><p>Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a
          teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can
          take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to
          hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest
          unoccupied spaces next to the circle.</p><p>You can use this spell to
          banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature
          within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit,
          the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails
          this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of
          existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way
          back to your current plane of existence.</p>
