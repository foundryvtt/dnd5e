      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplMending000]{Mending} and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplPrestidigi]{Prestidigitation}
      cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting
      <em>Prestidigitation</em> to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP),
      such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you
      determine its function by choosing one effect from
      <em>Prestidigitation</em>; the device produces that effect whenever you or
      another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the
      chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for
      the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's
      ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or
      extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three such
      devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its
      creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilize action.</p>
