    value: >-
      <p>You are descended from Giants. Choose one of the following benefitsâ€”a
      supernatural boon from your ancestry; you can use the chosen benefit a
      number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all
      expended uses when you finish a Long Rest:</p><p><strong>Cloud's Jaunt
      (Cloud Giant). </strong>As a Bonus Action, you magically teleport up to 30
      feet to an unoccupied space you can see.</p><p><strong>Fire's Burn (Fire
      Giant).</strong> When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage
      to it, you can also deal 1d10 Fire damage to that
      target.</p><p><strong>Frost's Chill (Frost Giant).</strong> When you hit a
      target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also deal 1d6
      Cold damage to that target and reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start
      of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Hill's Tumble (Hill Giant). </strong>When
      you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack roll and deal damage to
      it, you can give that target the Prone condition.</p><p><strong>Stone's
      Endurance (Stone Giant).</strong> When you take damage, you can take a
      Reaction to roll 1d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled
      and reduce the damage by that total.</p><p><strong>Storm's Thunder (Storm
      Giant).</strong> When you take damage from a creature within 60 feet of
      you, you can take a Reaction to deal 1d8 Thunder damage to that
      creature.</p>
