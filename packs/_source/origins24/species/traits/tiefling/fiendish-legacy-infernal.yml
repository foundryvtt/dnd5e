      <p>You are the recipient of a legacy that grants you supernatural
      abilities.</p><p>When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a
      higher-level spell, as shown on the table. You always have that spell
      prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the
      ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also
      cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the
      spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the
      legacy).</p><h3 data-anchor="infernal">Infernal</h3><p>The infernal legacy
      connects tieflings not only to Gehenna but also the Nine Hells and the
      raging battlefields of Acheron. Horns, spines, tails, golden eyes, and a
      faint odor of sulfur or smoke are common physical features of such
      tieflings, most of whom trace their ancestry to
      devils.</p><table><caption>Infernal Legacy
