      <p>You are the recipient of a legacy that grants you supernatural
      abilities.</p><p>When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a
      higher-level spell, as shown on the table. You always have that spell
      prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the
      ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also
      cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the
      spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the
      legacy).</p><h3 data-anchor="abyssal">Abyssal</h3><p>The entropy of the
      Abyss, the chaos of Pandemonium, and the despair of Carceri call to
      tieflings who have the abyssal legacy. Horns, fur, tusks, and peculiar
      scents are common physical features of such tieflings, most of whom have
      the blood of demons coursing through their
      veins.</p><table><caption>Abyssal Legacy
