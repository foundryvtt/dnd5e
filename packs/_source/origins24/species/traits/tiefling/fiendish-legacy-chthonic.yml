      <p>You are the recipient of a legacy that grants you supernatural
      abilities.</p><p>When you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a
      higher-level spell, as shown on the table. You always have that spell
      prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the
      ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also
      cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the
      spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the
      legacy).</p><h3 data-anchor="chthonic">Chthonic</h3><p>Tieflings who have
      the chthonic legacy feel not only the tug of Carceri but also the greed of
      Gehenna and the gloom of Hades. Some of these tieflings look cadaverous.
      Others possess the unearthly beauty of a succubus, or they have physical
      features in common with a night hag, a yugoloth, or some other Neutral
      Evil fiendish ancestor.</p><table><caption>Chthonic Legacy
