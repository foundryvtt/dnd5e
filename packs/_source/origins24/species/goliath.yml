      </strong>Humanoid</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>Medium (about 7–8 feet
      tall)</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> 35 feet</p><p>As a Goliath, you have
      these special traits.</p><p><strong>Giant Ancestry.</strong> You are
      descended from Giants. Choose one of the following benefits—a supernatural
      boon from your ancestry; you can use the chosen benefit a number of times
      equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a Long Rest:</p><p><strong>Cloud's Jaunt (Cloud Giant). </strong>As
      a Bonus Action, you magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied
      space you can see.</p><p><strong>Fire's Burn (Fire Giant).</strong> When
      you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also
      deal 1d10 Fire damage to that target.</p><p><strong>Frost's Chill (Frost
      Giant).</strong> When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage
      to it, you can also deal 1d6 Cold damage to that target and reduce its
      Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Hill's
      Tumble (Hill Giant). </strong>When you hit a Large or smaller creature
      with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can give that target the
      &amp;Reference[Prone] condition.</p><p><strong>Stone's Endurance (Stone
      Giant).</strong> When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to roll
      1d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the
      damage by that total.</p><p><strong>Storm's Thunder (Storm
      Giant).</strong> When you take damage from a creature within 60 feet of
      you, you can take a Reaction to deal 1d8 Thunder damage to that
      creature.</p><p><strong>Large Form.</strong> Starting at character level
      5, you can change your size to Large as a Bonus Action if you're in a big
      enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it
      (no action required). For that duration, you have Advantage on Strength
      checks, and your Speed increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you
      can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.</p><p><strong>Powerful
      Build.</strong> You have Advantage on any ability check you make to end
      the Grappled condition. You also count as one size larger when determining
      your carrying capacity.</p>
