      <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical
      essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.</p>

      <h5>Spell Slots</h5>

      <p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
      expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
      spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <em>animal friendship
      </em>and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
      cast <em>animal friendship </em>using either slot.</p>

      <h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>

      <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell
      list.</p>

      <p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more
      ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for
      which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this
      class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
      of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
      ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell
      slots.</p>

      <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>

      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your
      magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a
      spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
      Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you
      cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Wisdom modifier</p>

      <p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your
      Wisdom modifier</p>
