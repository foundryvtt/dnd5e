      <p>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and
      are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of
      favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or
      swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your
      favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a
      skill that you're proficient in.</p><p>While traveling for an hour or more
      in your favored terrain, you gain the following
      benefits:</p><ul><li>Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's
      travel.</li><li>Your group can't become lost except by magical
      means.</li><li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while
      traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to
      danger.</li><li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a
      normal pace.</li><li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you
      normally would.</li><li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn
      their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the
      area.</li></ul><p>You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and
      10th level.</p><section class="secret"
