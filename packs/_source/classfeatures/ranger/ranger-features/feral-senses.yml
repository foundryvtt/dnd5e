    value: >-
      <p>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight
      creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your
      inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls
      against it.</p><p>You are also aware of the location of any invisible
      creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden
      from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.</p>
