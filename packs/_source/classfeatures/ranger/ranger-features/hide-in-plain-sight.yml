      <p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for
      yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other
      naturally occurring materials with which to create your
      camouflage.</p><p>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to
      hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or
      wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus
      to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving
      or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must
      camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>
