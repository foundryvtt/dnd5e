      <p>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your
      dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or
      frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this
      power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60
      feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were
      casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn
      in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you
      chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A
      creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24
      hours.</p>
