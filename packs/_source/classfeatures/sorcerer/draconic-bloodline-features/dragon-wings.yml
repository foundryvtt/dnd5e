      <p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings
      from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You
      can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you
      dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.</p><p>You can't manifest your
      wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them,
      and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when
      you manifest them.</p>
