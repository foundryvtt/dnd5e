      <p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an
      indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic,
      whatever its origin, fuels your spells.</p>

      <h5>Cantrips</h5>

      <p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer
      spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at
      higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer
      table.</p>

      <h5>Spell Slots</h5>

      <p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you
      must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
      spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a
      1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands
      using either slot.</p>

      <h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>

      <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell
      list.</p>

      <p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more
      sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
      for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in
      this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
      of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
      sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
      spell slots.</p>

      <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>

      <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since
      the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into
      the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
      spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
      setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making
      an attack roll with one.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Charisma modifier</p>

      <p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your
      Charisma modifier</p>

      <h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>

      <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer
      spells.</p>
