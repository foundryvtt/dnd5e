    value: >-
      <p>When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and
      quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of
      any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your
      second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when
      you are surprised.</p>
