      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
      climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra
      movement.</p><p>In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance
      you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity
      modifier.</p>
