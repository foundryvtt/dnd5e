      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of
      power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a
      performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time,
      you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on
      saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able
      to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are
      incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action
      required).</p>
