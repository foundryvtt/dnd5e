      <p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you
      use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself
      within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic
      Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can
      roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll,
      or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the
      d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide
      before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic
      Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
      Inspiration die at a time.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of
      times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).</p><p>You
      regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Your Bardic
      Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The
      die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th
      level.</p><section class="secret"
