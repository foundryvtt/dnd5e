      <p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through
      meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.</p>

      <h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>

      <p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you
      must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
      spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to
      cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a
      number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your
      paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of
      a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

      <p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level
      and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of
      prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
      combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast
      it using a 1st-level or a 2ndlevel slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove
      it from your list of prepared spells.</p>

      <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
      rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer
      and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
      list.</p>

      <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>

      <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since
      their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your
      Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
      addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
      for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Charisma modifier</p>

      <p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your
      Charisma modifier</p>

      <h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>

      <p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin
      spells.</p>
