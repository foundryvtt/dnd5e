      <p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious
      odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an
      action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end
      of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or
      undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the
      type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense,
      but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for
      instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any
      place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.SLxA9QhrggTz0taU]{Hallow}
      spell.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your
      Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended
      uses.</p>
