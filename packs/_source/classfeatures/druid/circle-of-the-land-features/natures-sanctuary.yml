      <p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your
      connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you.</p><p>When a beast
      or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving
      throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
      must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a
      successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24
      hours.</p><p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its
      attack against you.</p>
