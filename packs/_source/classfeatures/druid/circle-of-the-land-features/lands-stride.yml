      <p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain
      costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
      without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
      have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p><p>In addition, you have
      advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or
      manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.gMrWeG8fMDPRFiVe]{Entangle} spell.</p>
