      <p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You
      can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it.
      You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as
      magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
      nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is
      more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if
      you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action
      required), or if you die.</p><p>You can transform one magic weapon into
      your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon.
      You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during
      a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an
      extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact
      weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in
      this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you
      perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour
      ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is
      in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p>
