    value: >-
      <p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an
      arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this
      arcanum.</p><p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a
      spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so
      again.</p><p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice
      that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one
      8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You
      regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>
