      <p>You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive
      through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the
      creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action
      on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration
      until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other
      creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that
      creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.</p>
