      <p>You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose
      two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list
      (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and
      don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of
      Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast
      the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other
      means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has
      the ritual tag.</p><p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells
      to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the
      book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level
      (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For
      each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs
      50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p>
