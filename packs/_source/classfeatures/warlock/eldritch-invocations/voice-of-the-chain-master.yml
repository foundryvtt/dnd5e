      <p>You can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive
      through your familiar's senses as long as you are on the same plane of
      existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar's senses,
      you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your
      familiar is normally incapable of speech.</p>
