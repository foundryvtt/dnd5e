      <p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring
      the undead.</p><p>Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of
      you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving
      throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p><p>A
      turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you
      as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
      It also can't take reactions.</p><p>For its action, it can use only the
      Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
      If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
