      <p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly
      from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with
      two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain.
      Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as
      noted in the domain description.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity,
      you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long
      rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects
      require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
      equals your cleric spell save DC.</p><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can
      use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th
      level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short
      or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p><section class="secret
