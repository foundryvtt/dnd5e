    value: >-
      <p>Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life. Your choice
      grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st
      level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you
      gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and
      17th levels.</p>

      <h5>Domain Spells</h5>

      <p>Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the
      cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain
      spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the
      number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>

      <p>If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell
      list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>
