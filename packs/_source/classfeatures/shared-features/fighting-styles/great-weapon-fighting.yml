      <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a
      melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die
      and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon
      must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this
      benefit.</p>
