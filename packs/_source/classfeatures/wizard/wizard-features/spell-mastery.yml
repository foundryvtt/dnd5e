      <p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that
      you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level
      wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at
      their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them
      prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must
      expend a spell slot as normal.</p><p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can
      exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the
      same levels.</p><section class="secret foundry-note"
