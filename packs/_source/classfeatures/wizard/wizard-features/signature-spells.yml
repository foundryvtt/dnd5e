      <p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells
      and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells
      in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells
      prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared,
      and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell
      slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or
      long rest.</p><p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you
      must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
