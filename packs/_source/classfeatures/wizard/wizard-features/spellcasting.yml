      <p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells
      that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>

      <h5>Cantrips</h5>

      <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard
      spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher
      levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>

      <h5>Spellbook</h5>

      <p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1stlevel wizard
      spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
      spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>

      <h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>

      <p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
      spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
      expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
      spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to
      cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal
      to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell).
      The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

      <p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and
      two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of
      prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
      combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
      spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level
      slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
      spells.</p>

      <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
      rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying
      your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make
      to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on
      your list.</p>

      <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>

      <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since
      you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use
      your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
      addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw
      DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
      one.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Intelligence modifier</p>

      <p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your
      Intelligence modifier</p>

      <h5>Ritual Casting</h5>

      <p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
      tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the
      spell prepared.</p>

      <h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>

      <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard
      spells.</p>

      <h5>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>

      <p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of
      your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a
      level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On
      your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your
      spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar).</p>
