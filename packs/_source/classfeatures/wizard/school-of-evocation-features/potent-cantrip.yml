    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures
      that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving
      throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage
      (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>
