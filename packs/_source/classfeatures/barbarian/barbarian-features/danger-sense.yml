      <p>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as
      they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from
      danger.</p><p>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against
      effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit,
      you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>
