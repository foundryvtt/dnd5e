    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone
      with your menacing presence.</p><p>When you do so, choose one creature
      that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear
      you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
      proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until
      the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
      extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the
      end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out
      of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p><p>If the creature
      succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature
      again for 24 hours.</p>
