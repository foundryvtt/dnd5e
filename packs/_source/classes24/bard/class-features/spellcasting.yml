      <p>You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.mh3akteBDiLegqFK]{chapter
      7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
      use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.wwia6Wwo4BgE9GSI]{Bard
      spell list}.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two cantrips of
      your choice from the Bard spell list.
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDancingLig]{Dancing
      Lights}</em> and
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplViciousMoc]{Vicious
      Mockery}</em> are recommended.</p><p>Whenever you gain a Bard level, you
      can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from
      the Bard spell list.</p><p>When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn
      another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the
      Cantrips column of the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbBard000000000.JournalEntryPage.V8pqIWlaL9GhY61t#class-features]{Bard
      Features} table.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Bard Features
      table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
      You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list.
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplCharmPerso]{Charm
      Person}</em>,
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplColorSpray]{Color
      Spray}</em>,
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDissonantW]{Dissonant
      Whispers}</em>, and
      <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplHealingWor]{Healing Word}
      </em>are recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as
      you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard
      Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells
      from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches
      the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
      you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of
      prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any
      combination.</p><p>If another Bard feature gives you spells that you
      always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of
      spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
      as Bard spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.
      </strong>Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your
      list with another Bard spell for which you have spell
      slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability. </strong>Charisma is your
      spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting
      Focus. </strong>You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus
      for your Bard spells.</p>
