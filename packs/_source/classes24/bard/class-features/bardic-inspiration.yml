      <p>You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance.
      This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which
      starts as a d6 (currently, [[lookup
      @scale.bard.inspiration.die]]).</p><p><strong>Using Bardic
      Inspiration.</strong> As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature
      within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains
      one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic
      Inspiration die at a time.</p><p>Once within the next hour when the
      creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration
      die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure
      into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's
      rolled.</p><p><strong>Number of Uses.</strong> You can confer a Bardic
      Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum
      of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels. </strong>Your Bardic Inspiration die
      changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die
      column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10
      at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.</p><section class="secret"

      feature includes an Active Effect for tracking when a character has Bardic
      Inspiration to use.</p><p>Recovery is set to long rest (for levels before
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classes24.Item.phbbrdFontOfInsp]{Font of
      Inspiration} is gained). Please manually adjust as required.</p></section>
