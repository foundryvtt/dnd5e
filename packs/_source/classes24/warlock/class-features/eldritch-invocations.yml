      <p>You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge
      that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain
      one invocation of your choice, such as
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classes24.Item.phbinvPactTome00]{Pact of the Tome}.
      Invocations are described in the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbWarlock000000.JournalEntryPage.FA4hxx49eazhISIt]{Eldritch
      Invocation Options} section.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> If an
      invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation.
      For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you
      can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level
      5.</p><p><strong>Replacing and Gaining Invocations.</strong> Whenever you
      gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another
      one for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a
      prerequisite for another invocation that you have.</p><p>When you gain
      certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown
      in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features
      table.</p><p><strong>Current Max Eldritch Invocations:</strong> [[lookup
      @scale.warlock.invocations-known]]</p><p>You can't pick the same
      invocation more than once unless its description says
      otherwise.</p><section class="secret"
      id="secret-Oe1om6AaBjTtabpK"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>You
      will be prompted for your choices as you level up. The advancement system
      does not prevent you from taking any invocations so be sure that you meet
      the requirements before selecting one.</p></section>
