      <p>Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious
      entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its
      identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast
      spells. See the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.mh3akteBDiLegqFK]{rules
      on spellcasting}. The information below details how you use those rules
      with Warlock spells, which appear in the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.sSzagq8GvYXpfmfs]{Warlock
      spell list}.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two Warlock
      cantrips of your choice.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplEldritchBl]{Eldritch Blast} and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplPrestidigi]{Prestidigitation}
      are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of
      your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your
      choice.</p><p>When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another
      Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the
      Warlock Features table.</p><p><strong>Current Max Cantrips Known:</strong>
      [[lookup @scale.warlock.cantrips-known]]</p><p><strong>Spell
      Slots.</strong> The
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbWarlock000000.JournalEntryPage.znue6EaGDDXgeQb0#class-features]{Warlock
      Features table} shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock
      spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all
      of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell
      slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.</p><p>For example, when you're
      a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1
      spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a
      level 3 spell.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You
      prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
      with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplCharmPerso]{Charm Person} and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplHex0000000]{Hex} are
      recommended.</p><p><strong>Current Max Prepared Spells:</strong> [[lookup
      @scale.warlock.max-prepared]]</p><p>The number of spells on your list
      increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
      column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases,
      choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list
      matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no
      higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
      When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which
      can be of levels 1–3.</p><p>If another Warlock feature gives you spells
      that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number
      of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
      count as Warlock spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared
      Spells.</strong> Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one
      spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible
      level.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Charisma is the
      spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting
      Focus.</strong> You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for
      your Warlock spells.</p>
