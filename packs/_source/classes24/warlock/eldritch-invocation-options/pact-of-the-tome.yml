      <p>Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your
      hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classes24.Item.phbwlkBookOfShad]{Book of Shadows}
      (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can
      access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you
      conjure another book with this feature or if you
      die.</p><p><strong>Cantrips and Rituals.</strong> When the book appears,
      choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual
      tag. The spells can be from any class's spell list, and they must be
      spells you don't already have prepared. While the book is on your person,
      you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells
      for you.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use the book
      as a Spellcasting Focus.</p>
