      <blockquote><p>Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock</p></blockquote><p>You can
      use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its
      senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the
      same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent
      turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of
      your next turn. The connection ends if you don't maintain it in this
      way.</p><p>While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you
      benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can
      cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature's space if
      the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.</p>
