      <p>When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning,
      Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the
      attack's total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your
      Dexterity modifier and Monk level.</p><p>If you reduce the damage to 0,
      you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack's force. If
      you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the
      attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of
      yourself that isn't behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged attack.
      That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage
      equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier.
      The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.</p><section
      class="secret" id="secret-zWGu1AEB09UqQ21D"><p><strong>Foundry
      Note</strong></p><p>The <strong>Reduce</strong> activity can be used to
      heal yourself to reduce the total damage if it's not enough to reduce it
      to 0.</p><p>The <strong>Redirect</strong> activity can be used to roll
      damage and consume a use of your Focus Points if you can reduce it to 0.
      You can select the type of damage in the roll dialog. The dice increase
      automatically as you level up.</p></section>
