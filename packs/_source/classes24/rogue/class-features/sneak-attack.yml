      <p>You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per
      turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an
      attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a
      Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the
      weapon's type.</p><p>You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at
      least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't
      have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the
      attack roll.</p><p>The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as
      shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features
      table.</p><p><strong>Current Sneak Attack Damage:</strong> [[lookup
      @scale.rogue.sneak-attack]]</p><section class="secret"
      id="secret-ulLpai4CguAExpmN"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>Your
      sneak attack damage will automatically scale as you level up. You can
      select the damage type in the damage roll's dialog box.</p></section>
