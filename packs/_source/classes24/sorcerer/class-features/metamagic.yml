      <p>Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit
      your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from "Metamagic
      Options". You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you
      cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that
      it costs.</p><p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you
      cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.</p><p>Whenever you
      gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with
      one you don't know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two
      more at Sorcerer level 17.</p><section id="secret-IKw7Qq4qXvzx5Iqj"
      class="secret"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>You will be prompted
      to choose Metamagic options as you level up.</p></section>
