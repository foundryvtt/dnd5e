      <p>Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.b2QVn25z2N1ykWpf]{rules
      on spellcasting}. The information below details how you use those rules
      with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.VfZ5mH2ZuyFq82Ga]{Sorcerer
      spell list} later in the class's
      description.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know four Sorcerer
      cantrips of your choice.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplLight00000]{Light},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplPrestidigi]{Prestidigitation},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplShockingGr]{Shocking Grasp},
      and @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplSorcerousB]{Sorcerous
      Burst} are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can
      replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer
      cantrip of your choice.</p><p>When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you
      learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips
      column of the Sorcerer Features table.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong>
      The
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSorcerer00000.JournalEntryPage.fsqRUA4acVXH4I3O#class-features]{Sorcerer
      Features table} shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
      spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. <em>Burning
      Hands</em> and <em>Detect Magic</em> are recommended.</p><p>The number of
      spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the
      Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that
      number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of
      spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The
      chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For
      example, if you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can
      include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.</p><p>If
      another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared,
      those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with
      this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for
      you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you
      gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another
      Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting
      Ability.</strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer
      spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use an Arcane
      Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.</p>
