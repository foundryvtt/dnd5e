      <p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel
      magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn
      Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class's
      Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to
      create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric
      levels.</p><p>You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain
      one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all
      expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when
      you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column
      of the Cleric Features table.</p><p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires
      a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's
      Spellcasting feature.</p><p><strong>Divine Spark.</strong> As a Magic
      action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within
      30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your
      Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to
      that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a
      failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice)
      equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
      damage (round down).</p><p>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric
      levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).</p><p><strong>Turn
      Undead.</strong> As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and
      censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you
      must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has
      the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that
      duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This
      effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the
      Incapacitated condition, or if you die.</p><section class="secret"
      id="secret-1ECtJAnUinEegKtL"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>This
      feature will automatically restore 1 use on a Short Rest and all on a Long
      Rest. The uses scale automatically as you level up.</p><p>The
      <strong>Divine Spark: Heal</strong> activity includes the healing
      effect.</p><p>The <strong>Divine Spark: Save</strong> activity includes
      the saving throw.</p><p>The <strong>Turn Undead</strong> activity includes
      an Active Effect that applies the Frightened and Incapacitated
      conditions.</p></section>
