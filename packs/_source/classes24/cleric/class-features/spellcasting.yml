      <p>You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.mh3akteBDiLegqFK]{chapter
      7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
      use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.SkHptN2PTzFGDaEj]{Cleric
      spell list}.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know three cantrips of
      your choice from the Cleric spell list.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGuidance00]{Guidance},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplSacredFlam]{Sacred Flame}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplThaumaturg]{Thaumaturgy} are
      recommended.</p><p>Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one
      of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell
      list.</p><p>When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another
      cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the
      Cantrips column of the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCleric0000000.JournalEntryPage.acPyA6A4DQBSnuZB#class-features]{Cleric
      Features} table.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Cleric Features
      table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
      You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplBless00000]{Bless},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplCureWounds]{Cure Wounds},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplGuidingBol]{Guiding Bolt}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplShieldofFa]{Shield of Faith}
      are recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you
      gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric
      Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells
      from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches
      the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
      you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list
      of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any
      combination.</p><p>If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you
      always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of
      spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
      as Cleric spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.
      </strong>Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of
      prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric
      spells for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.
      </strong>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric
      spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus. </strong>You can use a Holy
      Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.</p>
