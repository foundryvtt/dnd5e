      <p>The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a
      Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for
      this feature (see "Known Forms" below). You stay in that form for a number
      of hours equal to half your Druid level (currently [[lookup
      @classes.druid.levels]]) or until you use Wild Shape again, have the
      Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a
      Bonus Action.</p><p><strong>Number of Uses.</strong> You can use Wild
      Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and
      you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p><p>You gain
      additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild
      Shape column of the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbDruid00000000.JournalEntryPage.UCOh3zlvGxyk5jLr#class-features]{Druid
      Features} table.</p><p><strong>Current Number of Uses:</strong> [[lookup
      @scale.druid.wild-shape-uses]]</p><p><strong>Known Forms. </strong>You
      know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat
      blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly
      Speed. The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmRat00000000000]{Rat},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmRidingHorse000]{Riding Horse},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSpider00000000]{Spider}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWolf0000000000]{Wolf} are
      recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your
      known forms with another eligible form.</p><section class="fvtt

      /></figure><article><h3>Wild Shape Automation</h3><p>When you've selected
      the creature you would like to wild shape into you can drag it onto your
      character sheet, select the Wild Shape option, and Foundry will
      automatically update your sheet. You can revert the transformation at the
      top of your sheet or by right clicking on your Actor in the
      sidebar.</p></article></section><p>When you reach certain Druid levels,
      your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those
      forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting
      at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly
      Speed.</p><p><strong>Current Known Forms Limit:</strong> [[lookup
      @scale.druid.known-forms]]</p><p><strong>Current CR Limit:</strong>
      [[lookup @scale.druid.wild-shape]]</p><p>When choosing known forms, you
      may look in the <em>Monster Manual</em> or elsewhere for eligible Beasts
      if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.</p><table><caption>Beast

      While Shape-Shifted.</strong> While in a form, you retain your
      personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules
      apply:</p><p><strong>Temporary Hit Points. </strong>When you assume a Wild
      Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid
      level.</p><p><strong>Game Statistics.</strong> Your game statistics are
      replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit
      Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class
      features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving
      throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition
      to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw
      modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in
      the stat block.</p><p><strong>No Spellcasting.</strong> You can't cast
      spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise
      interfere with a spell you've already cast.</p><p><strong>Objects.
      </strong>Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs
      rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls
      in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment
      functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new
      form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape.
      Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any
      equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or
      merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect
      while you're in that form.</p><section class="secret"
