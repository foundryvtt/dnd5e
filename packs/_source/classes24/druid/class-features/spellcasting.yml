      <p>You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of
      nature. See
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.mh3akteBDiLegqFK]{chapter
      7} for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you
      use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.LhvuDQEyrCdg5EfU]{Druid
      spell list}.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two cantrips of
      your choice from the Druid spell list.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplDruidcraft]{Druidcraft} and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplProduceFla]{Produce Flame} are
      recommended.</p><p>Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of
      your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell
      list.</p><p>When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another
      cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips
      column of the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbDruid00000000.JournalEntryPage.UCOh3zlvGxyk5jLr#class-features]{Druid
      Features} table.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Druid Features
      table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
      You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplAnimalFrie]{Animal Friendship},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplCureWounds]{Cure Wounds},
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplFaerieFire]{Faerie Fire}, and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplThunderwav]{Thunderwave} are
      recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain
      Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features
      table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the
      Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the
      number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you
      have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of
      prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any
      combination.</p><p>If another Druid feature gives you spells that you
      always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of
      spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
      as Druid spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared
      Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list
      of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells
      for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.
      </strong>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid
      spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus. </strong>You can use a Druidic
      Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.</p>
