      <p>You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and
      weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your <em>Hunter's
      Mark</em>, you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances,
      or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they
      are.</p>
