      <p>You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever
      you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can replace the chosen option with
      the other one.</p><p><strong>Colossus Slayer.</strong> Your tenacity can
      wear down even the most resilient foes. When you hit a creature with a
      weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 damage to the target if it's missing
      any of its Hit Points. You can deal this extra damage only once per
      turn.</p><p><strong>Horde Breaker.</strong> Once on each of your turns
      when you make an attack with a weapon, you can make another attack with
      the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the
      original target, that is within the weapon's range, and that you haven't
      attacked this turn.</p><section class="secret"

      feature includes a <strong>Colossus Slayer</strong> activity for the
      additional damage. You can select the correct damage type in the roll
      dialog.</p><p>For the <strong>Horde Breaker</strong> option simply make
      another attack.</p></section>
