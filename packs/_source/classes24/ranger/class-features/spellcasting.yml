      <p>You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast
      spells. See the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.mh3akteBDiLegqFK]{rules
      on spellcasting}. The information below details how you use those rules
      with Ranger spells, which appear in the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.5HnIk6HsrSxkvkz5]{Ranger
      spell list}.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbRanger0000000.JournalEntryPage.fgzoeAJE4EEUSOYQ#class-features]{Ranger
      Features table} shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
      spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells.
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplCureWounds]{Cure Wounds} and
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplEnsnaringS]{Ensnaring Strike}
      are recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you
      gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger
      Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger
      spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the
      Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you
      have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Ranger, your list of
      prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any
      combination.</p><p>If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you
      always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of
      spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
      as Ranger spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared
      Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one
      spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell
      slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability. </strong>Wisdom is your
      spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting
      Focus. </strong>You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for
      your Ranger spells.</p>
