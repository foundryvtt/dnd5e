      <p>You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.mh3akteBDiLegqFK]{rules
      on spellcasting}. The information below details how you use those rules
      with Paladin spells, which appear in the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.8yD9Jgp404hfZ9ie]{Paladin
      spell list}.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbPaladin000000.JournalEntryPage.A34CXe4HdzXHoBEl#class-features]{Paladin
      Features table} shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
      spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the
      list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this
      feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. <em>Heroism</em> and
      <em>Searing Smite</em> are recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your
      list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
      column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases,
      choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list
      matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must
      be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a
      level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin
      spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.</p><p>If another Paladin
      feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't
      count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but
      those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for
      you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you
      finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another
      Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting
      Ability. </strong>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin
      spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus. </strong>You can use a Holy
      Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.</p>
