      <p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it
      to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense,
      which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel
      Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity,
      you choose which effect from this class to create.</p><p>You can use this
      class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when
      you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish
      a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level
      11.</p><p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC
      equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting
      feature.</p><p><strong>Divine Sense.</strong> As a Bonus Action, you can
      open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next
      10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the
      location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and
      you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the
      presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated,
      as with the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplHallow0000]{Hallow}
      spell.</p><section class="secret"
      id="secret-lIHCt32JLE7PAUbn"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>The
      uses of your Channel Divinity increase automatically as you level up. It
      automatically regains the correct uses after Short and Long
      Rests.</p><p>The <strong>Divine Sense</strong> activity includes an Active
      Effect but it does not automatically reveal the given
      creatures.</p></section>
