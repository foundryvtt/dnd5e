      <p>You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.
      When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to
      recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than
      half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or
      higher. For example, if you're a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two
      levels' worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or
      two level 1 spell slots.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so
      again until you finish a Long Rest.</p><p><strong>Combined Level
      Available:</strong> [[(@classes.wizard.levels / 2)]]</p><section
      id="secret-cO6X083GFJ1W4071" class="secret"><p><strong>Foundry
      Note</strong></p><p>Since you can select the slots you will have to
      manually adjust your available slots. This feature can be used to track
      the one-time use though.</p></section>
