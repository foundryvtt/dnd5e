      <p>You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your
      evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures
      that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the
      spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving
      throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally
      take half damage on a successful save.</p>
