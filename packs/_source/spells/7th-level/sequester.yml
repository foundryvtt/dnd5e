      <p>By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden
      away, safe from detection for the Duration. When you cast the spell and
      touch the target, it becomes Invisible and can't be targeted by divination
      spells or perceived through Scrying sensors created by Divination
      Spells.</p><p>If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of
      suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow
      older.</p><p>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The
      condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible
      within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when
      the Tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any
      damage.</p>
