      <p>Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a
      different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a
      60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a
      d8 to determine which color ray affects
      it.</p><ol><li><strong>Red</strong>. The target takes 10d6 fire damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</li><li><strong>Orange</strong>. The target takes 10d6 acid damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</li><li><strong>Yellow</strong>. The target takes 10d6 lightning
      damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</li><li><strong>Green</strong>. The target takes 10d6 poison damage
      on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</li><li><strong>Blue</strong>. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</li><li><strong>Indigo</strong>. On a failed save, the target is
      &amp;Reference[Restrained]. It must then make a Constitution saving throw
      at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the
      spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to
      stone and is subjected to the &amp;Reference[Petrified] condition. The
      successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both
      until the target collects three of a
      kind.</li><li><strong>Violet</strong>. On a failed save, the target is
      &amp;Reference[Blinded]. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the
      start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails
      that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of
      the DM's choosing and is no longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is
      on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other
      creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal
      planes.)</li><li><strong>Special</strong>. The target is struck by two
      rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.</li></ol>
