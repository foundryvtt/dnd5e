    value: >-
      <p>You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within
      range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a
      creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take
      actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be
      the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum
      and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the
      statistics of the creature it duplicates.</p><p>The simulacrum is friendly
      to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving
      and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in
      combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful,
      so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain
      expended spell slots.</p><p>If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair
      it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp
      per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit
      points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.</p><p>If
      you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created
      with this spell are instantly destroyed.</p>
