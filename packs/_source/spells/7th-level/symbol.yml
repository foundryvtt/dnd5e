      <p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a
      surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an
      object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll,
      or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area
      of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an
      object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more
      than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the
      spell ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly invisible,
      requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC
      to find it.</p><p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the
      spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers
      include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object
      covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating
      the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most
      common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain
      distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p><p>You can further
      refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain
      circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such
      as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set
      to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that
      don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain
      password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options
      below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a
      60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the
      spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is
      targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the
      first time on a turn or ends its turn
      there.</p><ul><li><strong>Death.</strong> Each target must make a
      Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save,
      or half as much damage on a successful
      save.</li><li><strong>Discord.</strong> Each target must make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues
      with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of
      meaningful communication and has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Ability
      Checks.</li><li><strong>Fear.</strong> Each target must make a Wisdom
      saving throw and becomes &amp;Reference[Frightened] for 1 minute on a
      failed save. While Frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and
      must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if
      able.</li><li><strong>Hopelessness.</strong> Each target must make a
      Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with
      despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't attack or target any
      creature with harmful Abilities, Spells, or other magical
      Effects.</li><li><strong>Insanity.</strong> Each target must make an
      Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane
      for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take Actions, can't understand what
      other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM
      controls its Movement, which is erratic.</li><li><strong>Pain.</strong>
      Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes
      &amp;Reference[Incapacitated] with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a
      failed save.</li><li><strong>Sleep.</strong> Each target must make a
      Wisdom saving throw and falls &amp;Reference[Unconscious] for 10 minutes
      on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses
      an action to shake or slap it awake.</li><li><strong>Stunning.</strong>
      Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes
      &amp;Reference[Stunned] for 1 minute on a failed save.</li></ul>
