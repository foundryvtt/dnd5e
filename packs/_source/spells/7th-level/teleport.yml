      <p>This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures
      of your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you
      can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an
      object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it
      can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.</p><p>The destination
      you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of
      existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether
      you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the
      table.</p>

      <p><strong>Familiarity</strong>. "Permanent circle" means a permanent
      Teleportation Circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Associated object"
      means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within
      the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen
      from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's Secret
      tomb.</p><p>"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place
      you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the
      spell. "Seen casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with
      which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen
      once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and
      appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a
      map.</p><p>"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you
      tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you
      are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer
      exists.</p><p><strong>On Target</strong>. You and your group (or the
      target object) appear where you want to.</p><p><strong>Off
      Target</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random
      distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off
      target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For
      example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a
      5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18
      miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8
      and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around
      the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and
      wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in
      trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the
      target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically
      similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory,
      for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an
      alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as
      your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but
      since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere
      on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable
      magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the
      target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to
      see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each
      time).</p>
