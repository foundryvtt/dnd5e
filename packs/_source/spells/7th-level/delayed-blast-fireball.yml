    value: >-
      <p>A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then
      condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for
      the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is
      broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar
      into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a
      20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving
      throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage
      on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The
      spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not
      yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.</p><p>If the glowing bead is
      touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must
      make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends
      immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the
      creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a
      solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.</p><p>The fire
      damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't
      being worn or carried.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage
      increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.</p>
