    value: >-
      <p>An immobile, Invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
      springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison
      can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.</p><p>A prison in the shape
      of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch
      diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.</p><p>A prison in the shape of a box
      can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any
      matter from passing through it and blocking any Spells cast into or out
      from the area.</p><p>When you cast the spell, any creature that is
      completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially
      within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed
      away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the
      area.</p><p>A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means.
      If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave
      the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the
      creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature
      can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage
      also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.</p><p>This
      spell can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic.</p>
