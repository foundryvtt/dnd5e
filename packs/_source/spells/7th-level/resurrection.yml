    value: >-
      <p>You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a
      century, that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is
      free and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit
      points.</p><p>This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases
      afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical
      diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to
      casting the spell, they afflict the target on its return to
      life.</p><p>This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing
      body parts.</p><p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes
      a âˆ’4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every
      time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it
      disappears.</p><p>Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that
      has been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a
      long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all
      attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>
