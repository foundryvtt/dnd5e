      <p>This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high Cylinder
      centered on a point within range. All creatures and Objects that aren't
      somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top
      of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity
      saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the
      fall.</p><p>If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in
      this fall, Falling Objects and creatures strike it just as they would
      during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of
      the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating
      slightly, for the Duration.</p><p>At the end of the Duration, affected
      Objects and creatures fall back down.</p>
