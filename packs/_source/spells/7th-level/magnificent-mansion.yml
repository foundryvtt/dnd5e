      <p>You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the
      Duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance
      shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature
      you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional
      dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the
      portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is
      Invisible.</p><p>Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous
      chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.</p><p>You can
      create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each
      cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as
      you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for
      up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent Servants attends all who
      enter. You decide the visual appearance of these Servants and their
      attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can
      perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't
      Attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus
      the Servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires,
      serve food, pour wine, and so on. The Servants can go anywhere in the
      mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other Objects created by this
      spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell
      ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into
      the open spaces nearest to the entrance.</p>
