      <p>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and
      even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape
      remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble
      a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A
      pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle
      slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth
      road.</p><p>Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add
      them where none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add
      creatures.</p><p>The Illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and
      olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or
      vice versa) or otherwise impede Movement through the area. Any piece of
      the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the
      spell's area disappears immediately.</p><p>Creatures with Truesight can
      see through the Illusion to the terrain's true form; however, all other
      elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the
      illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the
      illusion.</p>
