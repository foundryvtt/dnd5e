      <p>You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are
      transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target
      destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental
      Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine
      Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to
      reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of
      Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the
      Sea of Fire, at the DM's discretion.</p><p>Alternatively, if you know the
      sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence,
      this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too
      small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the
      closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.</p><p>You can use this spell
      to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within
      your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the
      creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this
      save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you
      specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your
      current plane of existence.</p>
