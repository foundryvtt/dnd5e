      <p>You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see
      within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution
      saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half
      as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>A humanoid killed by this spell
      rises at the start of your next turn as a Zombie that is permanently under
      your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.</p>
