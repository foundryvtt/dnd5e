    value: >-
      <p>Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you
      choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and
      is Blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much
      damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage
      on this saving throw.</p><p>A creature Blinded by this spell makes another
      Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful
      save, it is no longer blinded.</p><p>This spell dispels any Darkness in
      its area that was created by a spell.</p>
