    value: >-
      <p>A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in
      a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud
      spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the Duration
      or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour)
      disperses it.</p><p>When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make
      a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed
      save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also
      make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time
      on a turn or ends its turn there.</p><p>The cloud moves 10 feet directly
      away from you in a direction that you choose at the start of each of your
      turns.</p>
