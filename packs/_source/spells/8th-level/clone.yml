      <p>This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard
      against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full
      size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be
      a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures
      indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.</p><p>At any time
      after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its soul transfers
      to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to return. The
      clone is physically identical to the original and has the same
      personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's
      equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist,
      become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the
      creature's soul is elsewhere.</p>
