    value: >-
      <p>You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see
      within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass
      through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that
      appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or
      stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or
      objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also
      disappears from the other side.</p><p>Each time you cast this spell, you
      can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a
      demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally,
      if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of
      this spell by another creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to
      its demiplane instead.</p>
