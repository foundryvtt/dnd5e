      <p>Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing
      creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into
      the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or
      lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected
      creatures into new forms.</p><p>The transformation lasts for the duration
      for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You
      can choose a different form for each target. A target's game statistics
      are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target
      retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The
      target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its
      normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it
      transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any
      excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
      damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't
      knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform
      by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast
      spells.</p><p>The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't
      activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
