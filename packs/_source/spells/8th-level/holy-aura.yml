      <p>Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a
      30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when
      you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage
      on all Saving Throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on Attack
      rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an
      Undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes
      with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving
      throw or be Blinded until the spell ends.</p>
