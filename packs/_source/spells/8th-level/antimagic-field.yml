    value: >-
      <p>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area
      is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within
      the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even
      magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with
      you, centered on you.</p><p>Spells and other magical effects, except those
      created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't
      protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed.
      While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends
      suppressed counts against its duration.</p><p><strong>Targeted
      Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile
      and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have
      no effect on that target.</p><p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area
      of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into
      the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area
      that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames
      created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap
      in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p><p><strong>Spells.</strong>
      Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the
      sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in
      it.</p><p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic
      items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the
      sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p><p>A magic weapon's
      properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the
      sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a
      piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you
      fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere),
      the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it
      exits.</p><p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar
      travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination
      or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another
      location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an
      extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell,
      temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p><p><strong>Creatures and
      Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by magic
      temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature
      instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer
      within the sphere.</p><p><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong> Spells and magical
      effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the
      spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each
      other.</p>
