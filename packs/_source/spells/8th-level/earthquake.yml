      <p>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can
      see within range. For the Duration, an intense tremor rips through the
      ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes
      creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that
      area.</p><p>The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each
      creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's Concentration is
      broken.</p><p>When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you
      spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must
      make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked
      prone.</p><p>This spell can have additional Effects depending on the
      terrain in the area, as determined by the
      DM.</p><p><strong>Fissures</strong>. Fissures open throughout the spell's
      area at the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of
      1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each is 1d10 × 10
      feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to
      the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens
      must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that
      successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.</p><p>A
      fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse
      (see below).</p><p><strong>Structures</strong>. The tremor deals 50
      bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area
      when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the
      spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses and
      potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance
      of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
      save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is
      buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an
      action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on
      the Nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
      much damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.</p>
