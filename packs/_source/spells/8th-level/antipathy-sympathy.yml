      <p>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target
      something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an
      area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of
      intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You
      invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the
      specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the
      aura's effect.</p><p><strong>Antipathy.</strong> The enchantment causes
      creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the
      area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or
      comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
      throw or become &amp;Reference[frightened]. The creature remains
      frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While
      frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to
      the nearest safe spot from which it can't see the target. If the creature
      moves more than 60 feet from the target and can't see it, the creature is
      no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it
      regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of
      it.</p><p><strong>Sympathy.</strong> The enchantment causes the specified
      creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60
      feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or
      comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
      throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move
      within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't
      willingly move away from the target.</p><p>If the target damages or
      otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a
      Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described
      below.</p><p><strong>Ending the Effect.</strong> If an affected creature
      ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it,
      the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the
      creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of
      repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by
      the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the
      spell persists.</p><p>A creature that successfully saves against this
      effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected
      again.</p>
