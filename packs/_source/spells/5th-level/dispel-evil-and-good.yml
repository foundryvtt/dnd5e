      creatures originating from Beyond the Material Plane. For the Duration,

      Attack rolls against you.</p><p>You can end the spell early by using
      either of the following special functions.</p><p><strong>Break
      Enchantment</strong>. As your action, you touch a creature you can reach
      that is Charmed, Frightened, or possessed by a Celestial, an elemental, a
      fey, a fiend, or an Undead. The creature you touch is no longer charmed,
      frightened, or possessed by such
      creatures.</p><p><strong>Dismissal</strong>. As your action, make a melee
      spell Attack against a Celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an
      Undead you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to
      its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be
      sent back to its home plane (if it isn't there already). If they aren't on
      their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to
      the Feywild.</p>
