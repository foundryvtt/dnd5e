      <p>An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose
      within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a
      horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or
      resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a
      sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface
      made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous
      with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for
      the Duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears,
      the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which
      side).</p><p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to
      all damage and can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic. A Disintegrate spell
      destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the
      Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.</p>
