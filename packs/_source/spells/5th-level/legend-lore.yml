      <p>Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your
      mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named.
      The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret
      lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn't of
      legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you
      already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the
      information you receive is.</p><p>The information you learn is accurate
      but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a
      mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: "Woe
      to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the
      hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of
      Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred
      word Rudnogg on the lips."</p>
