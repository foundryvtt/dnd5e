    value: >-
      <p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you
      choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten
      10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one
      other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that
      are only 3 inches thick.</p><p>If the wall cuts through a creature's space
      when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your
      choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or
      the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity
      saving throw. On a success, it can use its Reaction to move up to its
      speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p><p>The wall can
      have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a
      creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any
      firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by
      existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a
      ramp.</p><p>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must
      halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the
      wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</p><p>The wall is an
      object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has
      AC 15 and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit
      Points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the
      DM's discretion.</p><p>If you maintain your Concentration on this spell
      for its whole Duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled.
      Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</p>
