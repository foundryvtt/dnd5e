      <p>You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy)
      power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if
      the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The
      affected area is subject to the following Effects.</p><p>First,
      Celestials, Elementals, fey, Fiends, and Undead can't enter the area, nor
      can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any
      creature Charmed, Frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer
      charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude
      one or more of those types of creatures from this effect.</p><p>Second,
      you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the
      following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. Some of these
      Effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the
      effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or
      leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or Trolls. When a
      creature that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first time
      on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw.
      On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the
      area.</p>
