      <p>Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical
      objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets
      count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets
      count as eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge.
      Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the
      spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p>As a bonus action, you
      can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature
      is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can
      command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to
      each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will
      move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to
      guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the
      creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an
      order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is
      complete.</p><table><caption>Animated Object

      is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity
      determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and
      Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object
      lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a
      flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached
      to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its
      speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond
      that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts
      to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its
      original object form.</p><p>If you command an object to attack, it can
      make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It
      makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined
      by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or
      piercing damage based on its form.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
      higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above
      5th.</p>
