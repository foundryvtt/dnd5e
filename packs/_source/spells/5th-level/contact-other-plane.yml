      <p>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some
      other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar
      intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell,
      make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic
      damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you
      can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read,
      and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends
      this effect.</p><p>On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five
      questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM
      answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe,"
      "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer
      to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might
      instead offer a short phrase as an answer.</p>
