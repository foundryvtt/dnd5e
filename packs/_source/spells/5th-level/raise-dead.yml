    value: >-
      <p>You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been
      dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at
      liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit
      point.</p><p>This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical
      diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell
      doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if
      these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect
      when the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead
      creature to life.</p><p>This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it
      doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts
      or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell
      automatically fails.</p><p>Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The
      target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability
      checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced
      by 1 until it disappears.</p>
