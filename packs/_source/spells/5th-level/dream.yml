      <p>This spell shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you
      as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of
      existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be
      contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a
      trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is
      aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take Actions or move.</p><p>If
      the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can
      converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the
      Duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape The Environment of the
      dream, creating landscapes, Objects, and other images. The messenger can
      emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early.
      The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake
      when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the
      trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which
      point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.</p><p>You can make the
      messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the
      messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the
      target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the
      phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the Duration of the
      target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that
      rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic
      damage.</p><p>If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail,
      or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw
      with disadvantage.</p>
