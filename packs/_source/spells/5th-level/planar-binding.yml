      <p>With this spell, you attempt to bind a Celestial, an elemental, a fey,
      or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the
      entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned
      into the center of an inverted Magic Circle in order to keep it trapped
      while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target
      must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve
      you for the Duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another
      spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration of this
      spell.</p><p>A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of
      its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an
      adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature
      obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to
      you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the
      creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends,
      it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of
      existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the
      place where you bound it and remains there until the spell
      ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of a higher level, the Duration increases to 10 days
      with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with
      an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell
      slot.</p>
