      <p>As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground
      inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation
      circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the
      same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the
      circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any
      creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the
      destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is
      occupied.</p><p>Many major temples, guilds, and other important places
      have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their
      confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of
      magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the
      ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two
      destinations on The Material Plane, determined by the DM. You can learn
      additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new
      sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.</p><p>You can
      create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same
      location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to Teleport
      when you cast the spell in this way.</p>
