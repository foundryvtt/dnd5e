    value: >-
      <p>Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a
      point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The
      sphere remains for the Duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The
      sphere's area is difficult terrain.</p><p>When the area appears, each
      creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes
      4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters
      the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn
      there.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10
      for each slot level above 5th.</p>
