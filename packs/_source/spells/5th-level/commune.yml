      <p>You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions
      that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before
      the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each
      question.</p><p>Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might
      receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that
      lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could
      be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a
      short phrase as an answer instead.</p><p>If you cast the spell two or more
      times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25
      percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
      The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>
