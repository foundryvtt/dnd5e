      <p>You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the
      surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of
      the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground
      settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn't function
      where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and
      towns.</p><p>You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your
      choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>terrain and bodies of water</li>

      <li>prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples</li>

      <li>powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead</li>

      <li>influence from other planes of existence</li>

      <li>buildings</li>

      </ul>

      <p>For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the
      area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the
      location of any nearby towns.</p>
