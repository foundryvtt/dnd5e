    value: "<p>You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within 'range': soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar.

The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.</p><p>The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vegetable matter\_- 1 day</li>\n<li>Stone or crystal\_- 12 hours</li>\n<li>Precious metals\_- 1 hour</li>\n<li>Gems\_- 10 minutes</li>\n<li>Adamantine or mithral\_- 1 minute</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong>\_When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.</p>"
