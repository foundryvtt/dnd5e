      <p>You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the
      same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving
      throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of
      physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting this
      spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be
      observed.</p>

      <p>On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this
      spell against it again for 24 hours.</p><p>On a failed save, the spell
      creates an Invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and
      hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the
      target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the Duration. A creature that
      can see Invisile Objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size
      of your fist.</p><p>Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a
      location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do,
      the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.</p>
