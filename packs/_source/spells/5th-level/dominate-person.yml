      <p>You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It
      must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be &amp;Reference[charmed] by you
      for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are
      fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p><p>While the target
      is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you
      are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to
      issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action
      required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and
      general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over
      there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and
      doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves
      itself to the best of its ability.</p><p>You can use your action to take
      total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn,
      the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything
      that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the
      creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction
      as well.</p><p>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom
      saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell
      ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10
      minutes. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is
      concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or
      higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.</p>
