    value: >-
      <p>After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a
      precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target
      must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less.
      The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability
      to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the
      ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it
      gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate
      for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or
      the awakened tree.</p><p>The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for
      30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When
      the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to
      remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was
      charmed.</p>
