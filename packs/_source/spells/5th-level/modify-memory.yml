      <p>You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that
      you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the
      creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the
      target becomes Charmed by you for the Duration. The charmed target is
      Incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear
      you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell
      ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.</p><p>While this
      charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it
      experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10
      minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the
      target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail,
      change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some
      other event.</p><p>You must speak to the target to describe how its
      memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for
      the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the
      details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished
      describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered.
      Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p><p>A
      modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves,
      particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural
      inclinations, Alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as
      implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in
      acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified
      memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant
      manner.</p><p>A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast on the
      target restores the creature's true memory.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels</strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
      higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up
      to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th
      level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).</p>
