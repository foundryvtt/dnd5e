      <p>You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by
      thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the
      Duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can
      see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the
      same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you
      switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the
      spell.</p><p><strong>Creature</strong>. You can try to move a Huge or
      smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability
      contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you
      move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not
      beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the
      creature is Restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward
      is suspended in mid-air.</p><p>On subsequent rounds, you can use your
      action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by
      repeating the contest.</p><p><strong>Object</strong>. You can try to move
      an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn
      or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but
      not beyond the range of this spell.</p><p>If the object is worn or carried
      by a creature, you must make an ability check with your Spellcasting
      ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you
      pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in
      any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.</p><p>You can exert
      fine control on Objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a
      simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item
      from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.</p>
