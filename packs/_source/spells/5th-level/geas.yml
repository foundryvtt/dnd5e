      <p>You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within
      range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or
      course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it
      must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become &amp;Reference[Charmed] by
      you for the Duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10
      psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your
      instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't
      understand you is unaffected by the spell.</p><p>You can issue any command
      you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death.
      Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.</p><p>You can end the
      spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A Remove Curse, Greater
      Restoration, or wish spell also ends it.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th
      level, the Duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
      of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the Spells
      mentioned above.</p>
