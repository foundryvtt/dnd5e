    value: >-
      <p>You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's
      wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends
      if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn't
      affected.</p><p>While in this form, the target's only method of movement
      is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of
      another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it
      has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The
      target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere
      cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The
      target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or
      otherwise incapacitated.</p><p>While in the form of a misty cloud, the
      target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying
      or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The
      target can't attack or cast spells.</p>
