      <p>You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a
      distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their
      spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they
      appear fiendish.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can designate any
      number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected
      creature's speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the
      area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant
      damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are
      evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
      damage.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for
      each slot level above 3rd.</p>
