    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall
      cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within
      range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are
      doused.</p><p>The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it
      difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first
      time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving
      throw. On a failed save, it falls Prone.</p><p>If a creature is
      concentrating in the spell's area, the creature must make a successful
      Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose
      concentration.</p>
