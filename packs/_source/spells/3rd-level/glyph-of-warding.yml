      <p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a
      magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a
      section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as
      a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can
      cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object
      is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is
      broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is
      nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation)
      check against your spell save DC to be found.</p><p>You decide what
      triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a
      surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the
      glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a
      certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the
      glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common
      triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain
      distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is
      triggered, this spell ends.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so
      the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to
      physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for
      example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or
      alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger
      the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you
      inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell
      glyph.</p><p><em><strong>Explosive Runes.</strong></em> When triggered,
      the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
      on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area
      must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [[/r 5d8]] acid,
      cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your
      choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Glyph.</strong></em> You can store a prepared
      spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating
      the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell
      being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph
      is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it
      targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an
      area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile
      creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as
      possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires
      concentration, it lasts until the end of its full
      duration.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this
      spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an
      explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If
      you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level
      as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.</p>
