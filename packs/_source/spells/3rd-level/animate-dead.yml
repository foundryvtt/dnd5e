      <p>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a
      corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the
      target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The
      target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a
      corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).</p><p>On each of your
      turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you
      made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you
      control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same
      time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the
      creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can
      issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or
      corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself
      against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to
      follow it until its task is complete.</p><p>The creature is under your
      control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've
      given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you
      must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour
      period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four
      creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new
      one.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control
      over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each
      of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.</p>
