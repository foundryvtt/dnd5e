      <p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered
      on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is
      heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the
      duration.</p><p>Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the
      start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On
      a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and
      reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison
      automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p><p>A moderate wind (at
      least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind
      (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.</p>
