    value: >-
      <p>A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around
      and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if
      you leave its area.</p><p>Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit
      inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger
      creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the
      dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other
      creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other
      magical effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. The
      atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the
      weather outside.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you can command the interior
      to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any
      color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.</p>
