    value: >-
      <p>A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose
      within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an
      additional 60 feet.</p><p>If you chose a point on an object you are
      holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the light shines from the
      object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an
      opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.</p><p>If any of
      this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of
      3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.</p>
