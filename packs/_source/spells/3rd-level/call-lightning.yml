    value: >-
      <p>A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall
      with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly
      above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the
      storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't
      accommodate the cloud).</p><p>When you cast the spell, choose a point you
      can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to
      that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a
      Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed
      save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns
      until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in
      this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.</p><p>If you
      are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell
      gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one.
      Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by
      1d10.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using
      a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each
      slot level above 3rd.</p>
