    value: >-
      <p>A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an
      unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's
      appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the
      equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is
      carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.</p><p>For the duration, you
      or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the
      statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can
      travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell
      ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount.
      The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes
      any damage.</p>
