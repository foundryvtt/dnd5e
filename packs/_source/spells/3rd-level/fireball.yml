    value: >-
      <p>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose
      within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.
      Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make
      a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save,
      or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The fire spreads around
      corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
      or carried.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for
      each slot level above 3rd.</p>
