    value: >-
      <p>You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature
      with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind,
      recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
      manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores
      of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.</p><p>You can
      send the message across any distance and even to other planes of
      existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a
      5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.</p>
