    value: >-
      <p>You imbue Plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and
      animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your
      simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area
      within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed,
      weather, and other circumstances.</p><p>You can also turn difficult
      terrain caused by Plant Growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into
      ordinary terrain that lasts for the Duration. Or you can turn ordinary
      terrain where Plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the
      duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for
      example.</p><p>Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf,
      at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable Plants to uproot
      themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils,
      and stalks.</p><p>If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate
      with it as if you shared a Common language, but you gain no magical
      ability to influence it.</p><p>This spell can cause the plants created by
      the Entangle spell to release a Restrained creature.</p>
