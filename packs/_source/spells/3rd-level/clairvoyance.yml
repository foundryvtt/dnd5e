      <p>You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to
      you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location
      that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a
      grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it
      can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.</p><p>When you cast the
      spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through
      the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch
      between seeing and hearing.</p><p>A creature that can see the sensor (such
      as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a
      luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.</p>
