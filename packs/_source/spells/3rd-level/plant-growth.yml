      <p>This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There
      are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or
      long-term benefits.</p><p>If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a
      point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on
      that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area
      must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.</p><p>You can
      exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being
      affected.</p><p>If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land.
      All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become
      enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when
      harvested.</p>
