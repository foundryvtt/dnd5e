      <p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a
      15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range.
      Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the
      first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving
      throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in
      the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving
      throw.</p>
              <p>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>
