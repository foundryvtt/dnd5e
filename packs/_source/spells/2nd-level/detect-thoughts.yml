      <p>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When
      you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends,
      you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30
      feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower
      or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p><p>You
      initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its
      mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to
      another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same
      creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving
      throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its
      emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as
      something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell
      ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and
      unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the
      creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
      contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell
      ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally
      shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective
      as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect
      the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell
      or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within
      30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2
      inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
      You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that
      doesn't speak any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a
      creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the
      duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still
      be within range.</p>
