      <p>By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose
      a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or
      a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a
      recipient who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman
      dressed in the uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a
      pointed hat." You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The
      target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified
      location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or
      25 miles for other animals.</p><p>When the messenger arrives, it delivers
      your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of
      your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the
      description you gave. If the messenger doesn't reach its destination
      before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way
      back to where you cast this spell.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
      higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot
      level above 2nd.</p>
