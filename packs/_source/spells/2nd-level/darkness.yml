    value: >-
      <p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a
      15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around
      corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and
      nonmagical light can't illuminate it.</p><p>If the point you choose is on
      an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the
      darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering
      the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a
      helm, blocks the darkness.</p><p>If any of this spell's area overlaps with
      an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that
      created the light is dispelled.</p>
