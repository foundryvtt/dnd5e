    value: >-
      <p>A 5-foot-diameter Sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your
      choice within range and lasts for the Duration. Any creature that ends its
      turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The
      creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
      a successful one.</p><p>As a Bonus Action, you can move the Sphere up to
      30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make
      the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving
      this turn.</p><p>When you move the Sphere, you can direct it over barriers
      up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere
      ignites flammable Objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright
      light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20
      feet.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for
      each slot level above 2nd.</p>
