      <p>You place an Illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that
      Divination Spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a
      willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by another
      creature.</p><p>When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the
      following Effects. The effect lasts for the Duration. If you cast this
      spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the
      same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is
      dispelled.</p><p><strong>False Aura</strong>. You change the way the
      target appears to Spells and magical Effects, such as Detect Magic, that
      detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a
      magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so
      that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose.
      When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic
      apparent to any creature that handles the
      item.</p><p><strong>Mask</strong>. You change the way the target appears
      to Spells and magical Effects that detect creature types, such as a
      paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a
      creature type and other Spells and magical Effects treat the target as if
      it were a creature of that type or of that Alignment.</p>
