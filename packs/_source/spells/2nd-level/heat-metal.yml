    value: >-
      <p>Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of
      heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the
      object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object
      takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you
      can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this
      damage again.</p><p>If a creature is holding or wearing the object and
      takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution
      saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object,
      it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of
      your next turn.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases
      by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
