    value: >-
      <p>You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the
      rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to
      the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to
      an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.</p><p>The
      extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope.
      The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope
      can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside
      the space.</p><p>Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into
      or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it
      as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the
      rope.</p><p>Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the
      spell ends.</p>
