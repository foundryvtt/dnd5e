      <p>Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a
      door, a box, a chest, a set of Manacles, a padlock, or another object that
      contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.</p><p>A target
      that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes
      unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one
      of them is unlocked.</p><p>If you choose a target that is held shut with
      Arcane Lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time
      the target can be opened and shut normally.</p><p>When you cast the spell,
      a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the
      target object.</p>
