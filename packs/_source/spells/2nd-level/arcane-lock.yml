    value: >-
      <p>You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it
      becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when
      you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a
      password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this
      spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the
      spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses
      arcane lock for 10 minutes.</p><p>While affected by this spell, the object
      is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any
      locks on it increases by 10.</p>
