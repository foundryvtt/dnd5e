      <p>You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the
      duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you
      can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the
      weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your
      spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you
      can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature
      within 5 feet of it.</p><p>The weapon can take whatever form you choose.
      Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St.
      Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's
      effect resemble that weapon.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When
      you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage
      increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.</p>
