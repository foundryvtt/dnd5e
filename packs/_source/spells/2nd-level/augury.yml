    value: >-
      <p>By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate
      cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an
      otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that
      you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the
      following possible omens:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Weal, for good results</li>

      <li>Woe, for bad results</li>

      <li>Weal and woe, for both good and bad results</li>

      <li>Nothing, for results that aren't especially good or bad</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that
      might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the
      loss or gain of a companion.</p><p>If you cast the spell two or more times
      before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent
      chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The
      DM makes this roll in secret.</p>
