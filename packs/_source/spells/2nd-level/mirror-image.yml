    value: >-
      <p>Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the
      spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting
      position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your
      action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.</p>

      <p>Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's
      duration, roll a [[/r 1d20 # Mirror Image Check]] to determine whether the
      attack instead targets one of your duplicates.</p>

      <p>If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the
      attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or
      higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.</p>

      <p>A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits
      a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only
      by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The
      spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.</p>

      <p>A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on
      senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive
      illusions as false, as with truesight.</p>
