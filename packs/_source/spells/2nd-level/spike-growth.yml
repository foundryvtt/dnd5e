    value: >-
      <p>The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists
      and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for
      the Duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4
      piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.</p><p>The transformation of
      the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the
      area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check
      against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before
      entering it.</p>
