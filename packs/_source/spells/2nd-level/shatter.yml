    value: >-
      <p>A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of
      your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere
      centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
      takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone,
      crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>A
      nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage
      if it's in the spell's area.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When
      you cast this spell using a 3 or higher level spell slot, the damage of
      the spell increases by 1d8 for each level of higher spell slot 2.</p>
