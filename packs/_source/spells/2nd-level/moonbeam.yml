    value: >-
      <p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius,
      40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell
      ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p><p>When a creature enters the
      spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is
      engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a
      Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save,
      or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>A Shapechanger makes its
      saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to
      its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the
      spell's light.</p><p>On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you
      can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any
      direction.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. When you cast this
      spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
      1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
