    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each
      humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within
      range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail
      this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw,
      choose one of the following two effects. You can suppress any effect
      causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any
      suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in
      the meantime.</p><p>Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about
      creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends
      if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of
      its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes
      hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise.</p>
