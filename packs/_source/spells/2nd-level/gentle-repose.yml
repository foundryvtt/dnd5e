      <p>You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is
      protected from decay and can't become undead.</p><p>The spell also
      effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead,
      since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the
      time limit of spells such as raise dead.</p>
