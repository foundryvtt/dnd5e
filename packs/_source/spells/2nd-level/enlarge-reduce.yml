      <p>You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow
      larger or smaller for the Duration. Choose either a creature or an object
      that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make
      a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no
      effect.</p><p>If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and
      carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature
      returns to normal size at once.</p><p><strong>Enlarge</strong>. The
      target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by
      eight. This growth increases its size by one category—from Medium to
      Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double
      its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the
      space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on
      Strength Checks and Strength Saving Throws. The target's Weapons also grow
      to match its new size. While these Weapons are enlarged, the target's
      attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.</p><p><strong>Reduce</strong>.
      The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced
      to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one
      category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the
      target also has disadvantage on Strength Checks and Strength Saving
      Throws. The target's Weapons also shrink to match its new size. While
      these Weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less
      damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).</p>
