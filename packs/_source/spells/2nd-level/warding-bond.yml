      <p>This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic
      connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the
      target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving
      throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes
      damage, you take the same amount of damage.</p><p>The spell ends if you
      drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more
      than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the
      connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.</p>
