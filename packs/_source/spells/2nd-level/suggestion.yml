    value: >-
      <p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
      magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and
      understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.
      The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of
      action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself
      onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends
      the spell.</p><p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
      save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its
      ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire
      duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time,
      the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to
      do.</p><p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special
      activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight
      give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't
      met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.</p><p>If you
      or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.</p>
