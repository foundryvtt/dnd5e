    value: >-
      <p>You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of
      sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would
      inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable,
      which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell
      would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a
      mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the
      floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.</p><p>This spell merely
      reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap,
      but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you
      sense.</p>
