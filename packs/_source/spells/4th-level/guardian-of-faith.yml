      <p>A Large Spectral Guardian appears and hovers for the Duration in an
      unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The
      guardian occupies that space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword
      and shield emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.</p><p>Any creature
      hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of the guardian for
      the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The
      creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
      on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60
      damage.</p>
