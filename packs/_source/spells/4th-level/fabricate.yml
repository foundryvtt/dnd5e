    value: >-
      <p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For
      example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope
      from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.</p><p>Choose raw
      materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or
      smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot
      cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working
      with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated
      object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot
      cube). The quality of Objects made by the spell is commensurate with the
      quality of the raw materials.</p><p>Creatures or Magic Items can't be
      created or transmuted by this spell. You also can't use it to create items
      that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry,
      Weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of
      artisan's tools used to craft such Objects.</p>
