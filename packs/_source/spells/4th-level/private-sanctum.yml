      <p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that
      can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell
      lasts for the Duration or until you use an action to dismiss
      it.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the
      spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded
      area.</li>

      <li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing
      vision (including darkvision) through it.</li>

      <li>Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected
      area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.</li>

      <li>Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.</li>

      <li>Nothing can Teleport into or out of the warded area.</li>

      <li>Planar Travel is blocked within the warded area.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this
      effect permanent.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the
      size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you
      could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a
      spell slot of 5th level.</p>
