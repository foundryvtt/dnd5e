      <p>Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's
      servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or
      activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply
      might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.</p><p>The spell
      doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the
      outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a
      companion.</p><p>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing
      your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each
      casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this
      roll in secret.</p>
