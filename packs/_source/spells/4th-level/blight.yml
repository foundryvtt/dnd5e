    value: >-
      <p>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can
      see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must
      make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has
      no effect on undead or constructs.</p><p>If you target a plant creature or
      a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the
      spell deals maximum damage to it.</p><p>If you target a nonmagical plant
      that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving
      throw, it simply withers and dies.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level
      or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
