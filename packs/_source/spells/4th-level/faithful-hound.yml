    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see
      within range, where it remains for the Duration, until you dismiss it as
      an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.</p><p>The
      hound is Invisible to all creatures except you and can't be harmed. When a
      Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking
      the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts
      barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the
      Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.</p><p>At the start of each of your
      turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is
      hostile to you. The hound's Attack bonus is equal to your Spellcasting
      ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing
      damage.</p>
