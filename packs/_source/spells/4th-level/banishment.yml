    value: >-
      <p>You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to
      another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving
      throw or be banished.</p><p>If the target is native to the plane of
      existence you're on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While
      there, the target is &amp;Reference[incapacitated]. The target remains
      there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the
      space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is
      occupied.</p><p>If the target is native to a different plane of existence
      than the one you're on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise,
      returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed,
      the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied
      space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't
      return.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional
      creature for each slot level above 4th.</p>
