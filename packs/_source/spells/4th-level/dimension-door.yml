      <p>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot
      within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place
      you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating
      distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to
      the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet."</p><p>You can bring along
      objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can
      also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying
      gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of
      you when you cast this spell.</p><p>If you would arrive in a place already
      occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with
      you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.</p>
