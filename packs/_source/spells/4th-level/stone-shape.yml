    value: >-
      <p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of
      stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that
      suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a
      weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long
      as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door
      or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to
      two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.</p>
