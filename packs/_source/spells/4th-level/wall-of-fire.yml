    value: >-
      <p>You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make
      the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed
      wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall
      is opaque and lasts for the duration.</p><p>When the wall appears, each
      creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
      save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a
      successful save.</p><p>One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast
      this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn
      within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same
      damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
      turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p><p><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
      level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
      4th.</p>
