    value: >-
      <p>Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the
      direction to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within
      1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of
      its movement.</p><p>The spell can locate a specific creature known to you,
      or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn),
      so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least
      once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such
      as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn't locate
      the creature.</p><p>This spell can't locate a creature if running water at
      least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.</p>
