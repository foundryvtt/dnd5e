      <p>You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be &amp;Reference[charmed] by you for
      the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting
      it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p><p>While the beast is
      charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are
      on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue
      commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required),
      which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general
      course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or
      "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't
      receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the
      best of its ability.</p><p>You can use your action to take total and
      precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the
      creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that
      you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the
      creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction
      as well.</p><p>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom
      saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell
      ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10
      minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is
      concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or
      higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.</p>
