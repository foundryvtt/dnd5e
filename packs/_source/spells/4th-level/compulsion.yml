      <p>Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can
      hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds
      on this saving throw if it can't be charmed. On a failed save, a target is
      affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action
      on each of your turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you.
      Each affected target must use as much of its movement as possible to move
      in that direction on its next turn. It can take any action before it
      moves. After moving in this way, it can make another Wisdom save to try to
      end the effect.</p><p>A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously
      deadly hazard, such as a fire or a pit, but it will provoke opportunity
      attacks to move in the designated direction.</p>
