      <p>Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area
      you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from
      any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on
      your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different
      one.</p><p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all
      standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area
      includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land, instead
      create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the
      other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's
      path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles
      struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p><p>The water
      level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different
      effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of
      your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p><p><strong>Part
      Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a
      trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated
      water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends
      or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the
      trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is
      restored.</p><p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in
      the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow
      over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in
      the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's
      area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water
      continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you
      choose a different effect.</p><p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect
      requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You
      cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a
      vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and
      25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of
      the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the
      vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save
      DC.</p><p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn
      or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a
      failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in
      the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes
      half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the
      vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described
      above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do
      so.</p><p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the
      object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it
      remains in the vortex.</p>
