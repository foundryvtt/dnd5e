      <p>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a
      new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid
      the effect. The spell has no effect on a Shapechanger or a creature with 0
      Hit Points.</p><p>The transformation lasts for the Duration, or until the
      target drops to 0 Hit Points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose
      Challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's
      level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game
      statistics, including mental Ability Scores, are replaced by the
      Statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its Alignment and
      personality.</p><p>The target assumes the Hit Points of its new form. When
      it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit
      points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping
      to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As
      long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0
      hit points, it isn't knocked Unconscious.</p><p>The creature is limited in
      the Actions it can perform by the Nature of its new form, and it can't
      speak, cast Spells, or take any other action that requires hands or
      speech.</p><p>The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature
      can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its
      Equipment.</p>
