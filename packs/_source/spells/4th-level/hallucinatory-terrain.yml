    value: >-
      <p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and
      smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road
      can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult
      or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a
      precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and
      smooth road. Manufactured structures, Equipment, and creatures within the
      area aren't changed in appearance.</p><p>The tactile characteristics of
      the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to
      see through the Illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a
      creature carefully examining the Illusion can attempt an Intelligence
      (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A
      creature who discerns the Illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague
      image superimposed on the terrain.</p>
