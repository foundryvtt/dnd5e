      <p>A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large
      size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the
      Duration.</p><p>Nothing—not physical Objects, energy, or other spell
      effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the
      sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a
      creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or Effects
      originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage
      anything outside it.</p><p>The sphere is weightless and just large enough
      to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its
      action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up
      to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and
      moved by other creatures.</p><p>A Disintegrate spell targeting the globe
      destroys it without harming anything inside it.</p>
