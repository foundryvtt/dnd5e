      <p>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for
      the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or
      cast this spell again.</p><p>If you create a sound, its volume can range
      from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a
      lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound
      continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete
      sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p><p>If you create an
      image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it
      must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light,
      smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image
      reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p><p>If
      a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can
      determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
      (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns
      the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the
      creature.</p>
