      <p>This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in
      diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an
      unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk
      remains for the Duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is
      placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the
      ground.</p><p>The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If
      you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it
      remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or
      down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change
      of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep
      pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the
      bottom.</p><p>If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically
      because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell
      ends.</p>
