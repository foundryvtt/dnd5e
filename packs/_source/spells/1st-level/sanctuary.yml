    value: >-
      <p>You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends,
      any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful
      spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell
      doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the
      explosion of a Fireball.</p><p>If the warded creature makes an attack or
      casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.</p>
