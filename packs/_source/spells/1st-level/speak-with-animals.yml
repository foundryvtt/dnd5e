      <p>You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts
      for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by
      their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about
      nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or
      have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast
      to perform a small favor for you, at the DM's discretion.</p>
