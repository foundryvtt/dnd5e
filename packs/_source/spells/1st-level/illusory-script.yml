      <p>You write on Parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material
      and imbue it with a potent Illusion that lasts for the Duration.</p><p>To
      you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing
      appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you
      intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if
      it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible.
      Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely
      different message, written in a different hand and language, though the
      language must be one you know.</p><p>Should the spell be dispelled, the
      original script and the Illusion both disappear.</p><p>A creature with
      Truesight can read the hidden message.</p>
