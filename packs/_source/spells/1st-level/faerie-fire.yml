    value: >-
      <p>Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green,
      or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is
      cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For
      the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot
      radius.</p><p>Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has
      advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object
      can't benefit from being invisible.</p>
