      <p>You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make
      a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your
      companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is
      &amp;Reference[charmed] by you until the spell ends or until you or your
      companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as
      a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was
      charmed by you.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one
      additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be
      within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</p>
