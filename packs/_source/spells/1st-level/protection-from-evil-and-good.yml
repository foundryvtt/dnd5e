    value: >-
      <p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected
      against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals,
      fey, fiends, and undead.</p><p>The protection grants several benefits.
      Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the
      target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by
      them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a
      creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the
      relevant effect.</p>
