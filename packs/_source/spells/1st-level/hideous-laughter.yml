    value: >-
      <p>A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives
      everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this
      spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall
      prone, becoming Incapacitated and unable to stand up for the Duration. A
      creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.</p><p>At
      the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target
      can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the
      saving throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell
      ends.</p>
