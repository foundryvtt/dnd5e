      <p>When you are damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can
      see, you point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is
      momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a
      Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or
      half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level
      or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
