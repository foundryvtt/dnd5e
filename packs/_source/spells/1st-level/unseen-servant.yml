      <p>This spell creates an &amp;Reference[Invisible], mindless, shapeless,
      Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell
      ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the
      ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and
      it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.</p><p>Once
      on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you can mentally command the
      servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can
      perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching
      things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food,
      and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task
      to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for
      your next command.</p><p>If you command the servant to perform a task that
      would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</p>
