      <p>A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a
      15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw.
      On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10
      feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
      damage and isn't pushed.</p><p>In addition, unsecured objects that are
      completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away
      from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom
      audible out to 300 feet.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
      increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
