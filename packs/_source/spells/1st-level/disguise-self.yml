      <p>You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other
      belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you
      use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and
      can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so
      you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.
      Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p><p>The changes
      wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example,
      if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through
      the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your
      head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the
      hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it
      was seemingly still in midair.</p><p>To discern that you are disguised, a
      creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on
      an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p>
