      <p>For the spell's Duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with
      dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you
      can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the
      following Effects of your choice for the Duration. On each of your turns
      until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature
      but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw
      against this casting of eyebite.</p><ul><li><strong>Asleep</strong>. The
      target falls &amp;Reference[Unconscious]. It wakes up if it takes any
      damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper
      awake.</li><li><strong>Panicked</strong>. The target is
      &amp;Reference[Frightened] of you. On each of its turns, the frightened
      creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest
      and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the
      target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no
      longer see you, this effect ends.</li><li><strong>Sickened</strong>. The
      target has disadvantage on Attack rolls and Ability Checks. At the end of
      each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it
      succeeds, the effect ends</li></ul>
