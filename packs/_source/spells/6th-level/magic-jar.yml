      <p>Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and
      enters the container you used for the spell's material component. While
      your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if
      you were in the container's space. You can't move or use reactions. The
      only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the
      container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or
      attempting to possess a humanoids body.</p><p>You can attempt to possess
      any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by
      a protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can't be possessed).
      The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul
      moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the
      container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it,
      and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.</p><p>Once you
      possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are
      replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your
      alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain
      the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class
      levels, you can't use any of its class features.</p><p>Meanwhile, the
      possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own
      senses, but it can't move or take actions at all.</p><p>While possessing a
      body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the
      container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature's
      soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature
      dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own
      spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within
      100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.</p><p>If the container is destroyed
      or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your
      body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead when you
      attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature's soul is in the
      container when it is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if
      the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature
      dies.</p><p>When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.</p>
