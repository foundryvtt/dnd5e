      <p>A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide,
      60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is
      Blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much
      damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage
      on this saving throw.</p><p>You can create a new line of radiance as your
      action on any turn until the spell ends.</p><p>For the Duration, a mote of
      brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot
      radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is
      sunlight.</p>
