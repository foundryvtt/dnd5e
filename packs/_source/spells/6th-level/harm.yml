    value: >-
      <p>You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within
      range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
      it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful
      save. The damage can't reduce the target's Hit Points below 1. If the
      target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 Hour
      by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes
      a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before
      that time passes.</p>
