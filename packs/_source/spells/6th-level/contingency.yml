      <p>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a
      casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that
      spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency,
      expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into
      effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You
      describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a
      contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that water breathing
      comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar
      liquid.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the
      circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to. and
      then contingency ends.</p><p>The contingent spell takes effect only on
      you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one
      contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of
      another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if
      its material component is ever not on your person.</p>
