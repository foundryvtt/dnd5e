    value: >-
      <p>An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a
      10-foot radius around you and remains for the Duration.</p><p>Any spell of
      5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or
      Objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell
      slot. Such a spell can target creatures and Objects within the barrier,
      but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the
      barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such
      Spells.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks Spells of
      one level higher for each slot level above 6th.</p>
