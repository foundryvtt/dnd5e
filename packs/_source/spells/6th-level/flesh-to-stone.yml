      <p>You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into
      stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is
      &amp;Reference[Restrained] as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful
      save, the creature isn't affected.</p><p>A creature Restrained by this
      spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the
      spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and
      subjected to the &amp;Reference[Petrified] condition for the Duration. The
      successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both
      until the target collects three of a kind.</p><p>If the creature is
      physically broken while Petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if
      it reverts to its original state.</p><p>If you maintain your Concentration
      on this spell for the entire possible Duration, the creature is turned to
      stone until the effect is removed.</p>
