      <p>You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of
      magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration.
      You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet
      thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5
      feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it,
      and its space is difficult terrain.</p><p>When a creature enters the
      wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the
      creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature
      takes half as much damage.</p>
