    value: >-
      <p>You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a
      gaseous form for the Duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this
      cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance
      to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only Actions a creature can take in
      this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting
      takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is Incapacitated and can't
      move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which
      also requires the 1-minute transformation.</p>
              <p>If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.</p>
