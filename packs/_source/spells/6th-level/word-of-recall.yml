    value: >-
      <p>You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly
      teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that
      teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you
      designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this
      spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no
      effect.</p><p>You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within
      a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your
      deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that
      isn't dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.</p>
