      <p>You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000
      square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For the
      Duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals, such as
      those created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the
      area against Planar Travel, and therefore prevents creatures from
      accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild,
      Shadowfell, or the Plane Shift spell.</p><p>In addition, the spell damages
      types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of
      the following: Celestials, Elementals, fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a
      chosen creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or
      starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage
      (your choice when you cast this spell).</p><p>When you cast this spell,
      you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it
      enters the area takes no damage from the spell.</p><p>The spell's area
      can't overlap with the area of another forbiddance spell. If you cast
      forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts
      until it is dispelled, and the material Components are consumed on the
      last casting.</p>
