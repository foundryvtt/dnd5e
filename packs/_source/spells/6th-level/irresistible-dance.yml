    value: >-
      <p>Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a
      comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the
      duration. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this
      spell.</p><p>A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without
      leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and
      attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures
      have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing
      creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a
      successful save, the spell ends.</p>
