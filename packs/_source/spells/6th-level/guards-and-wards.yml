    value: >-
      <p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space
      (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five
      10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as
      you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the
      area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while
      you are casting the spell.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can specify
      individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the Effects that you
      choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the
      speaker immune to these Effects.</p><p>Guards and wards creates the
      following Effects within the warded
      area.</p><p><strong>Corridors</strong>. Fog fills all the warded
      corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection
      or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent
      chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the
      opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p><p><strong>Doors</strong>.
      All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an
      Arcane Lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an
      Illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the Minor Illusion
      spell) to make them appear as plain sections of
      wall.</p><p><strong>Stairs</strong>. Webs fill all stairs in the warded
      area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10
      minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards
      lasts.</p><p><strong>Other Spell Effect</strong>. You can place your
      choice of one of the following magical Effects within the warded area of
      the stronghold.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Place Dancing Lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple
      program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.</li>

      <li>Place Magic Mouth in two locations.</li>

      <li>Place Stinking Cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places
      you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while
      guards and wards lasts.</li>

      <li>Place a constant Gust of Wind in one corridor or room.</li>

      <li>Place a Suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet
      square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives
      the Suggestion mentally.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A Dispel Magic cast on a specific
      effect, if successful, removes only that effect.</p><p>You can create a
      permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every
      day for one year.</p>
