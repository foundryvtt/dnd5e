    value: >-
      <p>Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within
      range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you
      choose for the Duration. You can raise or lower the area's elevation,
      create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The
      extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension.
      So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet
      high, raise or lower the square's elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench
      up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to
      complete.</p><p>At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on
      the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.</p><p>Because
      the terrain's transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can't
      usually be trapped or injured by the ground's Movement.</p><p>This spell
      can't manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures
      shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain
      would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.</p><p>Similarly, this
      spell doesn't directly affect Plant Growth. The moved earth carries any
      Plants along with it.</p>
