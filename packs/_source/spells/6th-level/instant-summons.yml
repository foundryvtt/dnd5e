    value: >-
      <p>You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension
      is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an Invisible mark on its surface and
      invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the
      material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a
      different sapphire.</p><p>At any time thereafter, you can use your action
      to speak the item's name and crush the sapphire. The item instantly
      appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the
      spell ends.</p><p>If another creature is holding or carrying the item,
      crushing the sapphire doesn't transport the item to you, but instead you
      learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that
      creature is located at that moment.</p><p>Dispel Magic or a similar effect
      successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell's effect.</p>
