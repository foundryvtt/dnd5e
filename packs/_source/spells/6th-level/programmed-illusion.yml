      <p>You create an Illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs.
      The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a
      30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion
      behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted Performance can last up to
      5 minutes.</p><p>When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion
      springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the
      illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10
      minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.</p><p>The
      triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though
      it must be based on visual or audible Conditions that occur within 30 feet
      of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to
      appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you
      could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct
      word or phrase.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be
      an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its
      action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a
      successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
      If a creature discerns the Illusion for what it is, the creature can see
      through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the
      creature</p>
