    value: >-
      <p>A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point
      of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere.
      Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
      failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it
      takes half as much damage.</p><p>If the globe strikes a body of water or a
      liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it
      freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square.
      This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface
      of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an
      action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break
      free.</p><p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the
      spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to
      the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give
      the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a
      sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same
      effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down
      without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already
      shattered, it explodes.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage
      increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
