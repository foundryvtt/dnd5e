    value: >-
      <p>You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with
      needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and
      lasts for the Duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10
      feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is
      up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of
      sight.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must
      make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8
      piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p>A
      creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every
      1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of
      Movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn
      or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
      It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage
      increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
