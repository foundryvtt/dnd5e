      <p>This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route
      to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane
      of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a
      destination that moves (such as a Mobile fortress), or a destination that
      isn't specific (such as "a green dragon's lair"), the spell
      fails.</p><p>For the Duration, as long as you are on the same plane of
      existence as the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction
      it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a
      choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is
      the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route)
      to the destination.</p>
