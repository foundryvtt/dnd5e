      <p>You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink.
      The feast takes 1 Hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time,
      and the beneficial Effects don't set in until this hour is over. Up to
      twelve creatures can partake of the feast.</p><p>A creature that partakes
      of the feast gains several benefits. The creature is cured of all Diseases
      and poison, becomes immune to poison and being Frightened, and makes all
      Wisdom Saving Throws with advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases
      by 2d10, and it gains the same number of Hit Points. These benefits last
      for 24 hours.</p>
