    value: >-
      <p>A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you
      can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a
      creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of
      force.</p><p>A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage.
      The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit
      points.</p><p>A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and
      carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
      creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a
      wish spell.</p><p>This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or
      smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is
      a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a
      10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this
      spell.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for
      each slot level above 6th.</p>
