    value: >-
      <p>You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years
      and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is
      free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit
      points.</p><p>This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures
      all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died.
      The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature
      was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.</p><p>The spell can
      even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case
      you must speak the creature's name. The creature then appears in an
      unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.</p>
