      <p>You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time
      passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during
      which you can use Actions and move as normal.</p><p>This spell ends if one
      of the Actions you use during this period, or any Effects that you create
      during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being
      worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if
      you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast
      it.</p>
