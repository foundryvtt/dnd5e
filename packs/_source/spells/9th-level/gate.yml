    value: >-
      <p>You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within
      range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal
      is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You
      can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for
      the Duration.</p><p>The portal has a front and a back on each plane where
      it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through
      its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other
      plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the
      portal.</p><p>Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created
      by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their
      domains.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a
      specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that
      creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in
      the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it
      to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no
      special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems
      appropriate. It might leave, Attack you, or help you.</p>
