      <p>A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque
      wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a
      point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into
      a Sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within
      range. The wall remains in place for the Duration. If you position the
      wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell
      fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.</p><p>The wall sheds
      bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional
      100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell
      can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another
      creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its
      turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or
      become Blinded for 1 minute.</p><p>The wall consists of seven layers, each
      with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass
      through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's
      layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make
      a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as
      described below.</p><p>The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a
      time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a
      layer is destroyed, it remains so for the Duration of the spell. An
      Antimagic Field has no effect on the wall, and Dispel Magic works only
      against the violet layer.</p>

      <ol>

      <li><strong>Red</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed
      save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in
      place, nonmagical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer
      can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.</li>

      <li><strong>Orange</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer
      is in place, magical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer
      is destroyed by a strong wind.</li>

      <li><strong>Yellow</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be
      destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.</li>

      <li><strong>Green</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Passwall spell,
      or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a
      solid surface, destroys this layer.</li>

      <li><strong>Blue</strong>. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed
      save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be
      destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.</li>

      <li><strong>Indigo</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Restrained.
      It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails
      its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to
      the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be
      consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a
      kind.

      <ul>

      <li>While this layer is in place, Spells can't be cast through the wall.
      The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a Daylight spell or a
      similar spell of equal or higher level.</li>

      </ul>

      </li>

      <li><strong>Violet</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is Blinded. It
      must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A
      successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is
      transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer
      Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home
      plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the
      Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a Dispel Magic
      spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end Spells and
      magical Effects.</li>
