      <p>You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral
      bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if
      you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
      unconscious and in a state of suspended animation, it doesn't need food or
      air and doesn't age.</p><p>Your astral body resembles your mortal form in
      almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The
      principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from
      between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility
      after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as
      the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is
      cut-something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that
      it does-your soul and body are separated, killing you
      instantly.</p><p>Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral
      Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If
      you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this
      spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord,
      allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral
      form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to
      it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you
      return to it.</p><p>The spell ends for you and your companions when you
      use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature
      returns to its physical body, and it awakens.</p><p>The spell might also
      end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic
      spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
      creature. If a creature's original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit
      points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver
      cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature's astral form back to its
      body, ending its state of suspended animation.</p><p>If you are returned
      to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and
      must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit
      points.</p>
