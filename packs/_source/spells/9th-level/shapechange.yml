      <p>You assume the form of a different creature for the Duration. The new
      form can be of any creature with a Challenge rating equal to your level or
      lower. The creature can't be a construct or an Undead, and you must have
      seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an average
      example of that creature, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting
      trait.</p><p>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
      chosen creature, though you retain your Alignment and Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving
      throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
      creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its
      Statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of
      yours. You can't use any legendary Actions or Lair Actions of the new
      form.</p><p>You assume the Hit Points and Hit Dice of the new form. When
      you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit Points you
      had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of Dropping to 0 Hit
      Points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the
      excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 Hit Points, you aren't
      knocked Unconscious.</p><p>You retain the benefit of any features from
      your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new
      form is physically capable of doing so. You can't use any Special Senses
      you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that
      sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.</p><p>When
      you transform, you choose whether your Equipment falls to the ground,
      merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as
      normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear
      a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your
      equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any
      equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or
      merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that
      state.</p><p>During this spell's Duration, you can use your action to
      assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the
      original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points
      than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.</p>
