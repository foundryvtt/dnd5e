      <p>You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see
      within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound
      by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it
      again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe,
      eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination Spells can't locate or
      perceive the target.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you choose one of the
      following forms of imprisonment.</p><p><strong>Burial</strong>. The target
      is entombed far beneath the earth in a Sphere of magical force that is
      just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the
      sphere, nor can any creature Teleport or use Planar Travel to get into or
      out of it. The special component for this version of the spell is a small
      mithral orb.</p><p><strong>Chaining</strong>. Heavy chains, firmly rooted
      in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is Restrained until
      the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then. The
      special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of
      precious metal.</p><p><strong>Hedged Prison</strong>. The spell transports
      the target into a tiny Demiplane that is warded against teleportation and
      Planar Travel. The Demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any
      similar confined structure or area of your choice. The special component
      for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison
      made from jade.</p><p><strong>Minimus Containment</strong>. The target
      shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or
      similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the
      target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can
      pass through, even by means of teleportation or Planar Travel. The
      gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect. The
      special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent
      gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or
      ruby.</p><p><strong>Slumber</strong>. The target falls asleep and can't be
      awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of
      rare soporific herbs.</p><p><strong>Ending the Spell</strong>. During the
      casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition
      that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can
      be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that
      the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The
      Conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but
      otherwise must be based on observable Actions or qualities and not based
      on intangibles such as level, class, or Hit Points.</p><p>A Dispel Magic
      spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting
      either the prison or the special component used to create it.</p><p>You
      can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a
      time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of
      the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.</p>
