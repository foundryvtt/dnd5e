        <p>The three main pillars of D&amp;D play are social interaction,
        exploration, and combat. Whichever one you’re experiencing, the game
        unfolds according to this basic pattern:</p><ol><li><strong>The Game
        Master Describes a Scene.</strong> The GM tells the players where their
        adventurers are and what’s around them (how many doors lead out of a
        room, what’s on a table, and so on).</li><li><strong>The Players
        Describe What Their Characters Do.</strong> Typically, the characters
        stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment.
        Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer
        might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious
        symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside
        combat, the GM ensures that every character has a chance to act and
        decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take
        turns.</li><li><strong>The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers’
        Actions.</strong> Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer
        walks across a room and tries to open a door, the GM might say the door
        opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the
        floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it
        challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM
        might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens.
        Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which
        brings the game back to step 1.</li></ol><p>This pattern holds during
        every game session (each time you sit down to play D&amp;D), whether the
        adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a
        dragon. In certain situations—particularly combat—the action is more
        structured, and everyone takes turns.</p><aside
        class="notable"><h3>Exceptions Supersede General Rules</h3><p>General
        rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell
        you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity.
        That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as
        something in the game doesn’t explicitly say otherwise.</p><p>The game
        also includes elements—class features, feats, weapon properties, spells,
        magic items, monster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contradict a
        general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the
        exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee
        attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement
        disagrees with the general rule.</p></aside>

        <p>All creatures—characters and monsters—have six abilities that measure
        physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability
        Descriptions table.</p><table><caption>Ability

        Scores</h2><p>Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some
        monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude
        of an ability. The Ability Scores table summarizes what the scores
        mean.</p><table><caption>Ability

        is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to
        0, that effect explains what

        weak capability.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10–11</p></td><td><p>This

        otherwise.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>21–29</p></td><td><p>This represents

        highest a score can go.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Ability
        Modifiers</h2><p>Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you
        make a &amp;Reference[d20test] with that ability. An ability modifier is
        derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers
        table.</p><aside class="notable"><h3>Round Down</h3><p>Whenever you
        divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a
        fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make
        an exception and tell you to round
        up.</p></aside><table><caption>Ability
