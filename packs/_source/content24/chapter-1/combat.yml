        <p>A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides: a flurry of
        weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game
        organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents
        about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a
        battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning
        of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a
        turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is
        defeated.</p><h2>Combat Step by Step</h2><p>Combat unfolds in these
        steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Establish Positions.</strong> The Dungeon
        Master determines where all the characters and monsters are located.
        Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the
        room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are—how
        far away and in what direction.</li><li><strong>Roll
        Initiative.</strong> Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls
        Initiative, determining the order of combatants’
        turns.</li><li><strong>Take Turns.</strong> Each participant in the
        battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the
        combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat this step until the
        fighting stops.</li></ol>

        <p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat
        starts, every participant rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check
        that determines their place in the Initiative order. The GM rolls for
        monsters. For a group of identical creatures, the GM makes a single
        roll, so each member of the group has the same
        Initiative.</p><p><em><strong>Surprise.</strong></em> If a combatant is
        surprised by combat starting, that combatant has
        &amp;Reference[Disadvantage] on their Initiative roll. For example, if
        an ambusher starts combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware that
        combat is starting, that foe is surprised.</p><p><em><strong>Initiative
        Order.</strong></em> A combatant’s check total is called their
        Initiative count, or Initiative for short. The GM ranks the combatants,
        from highest to lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act
        during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to
        round.</p><p><em><strong>Ties.</strong></em> If a tie occurs, the DM
        decides the order among tied monsters, and the players decide the order
        among tied characters. The GM decides the order if the tie is between a
        monster and a player character.</p><section class="fvtt advice"><figure

        play using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these
        rules.</p><p><span><em><strong>Squares.</strong></em></span> Each square
        represents 5 feet.</p><p><span><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em></span>
        Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid,
        using your Speed in 5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into
        squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of 30 feet translates
        into 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing your Speed in
        squares on your character sheet.</p><p><span><em><strong>Entering a
        Square.</strong></em></span> To enter a square, you must have enough
        movement left to pay for entering. It costs 1 square of movement to
        enter an unoccupied square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally
        or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares
        to enter. Other effects might make a square cost even
        more.</p><p><span><em><strong>Corners.</strong></em></span> Diagonal
        movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another
        terrain feature that fills its
        space.</p><p><span><em><strong>Ranges.</strong></em></span> To determine
        the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or
        objects—count squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop
        counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest
        route.</p></aside><h2>Difficult
        Terrain</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbAppendixDRule.JournalEntryPage.6tqz947qO8vPyxvD
        inline]</p><h2>Breaking Up Your Move</h2><p>You can break up your move,
        using some of its movement before and after any action, Bonus Action, or
        Reaction you take on the same turn. For example, if you have a Speed of
        30 feet, you could go 10 feet, take an action, and then go 20
        feet.</p><h2>Dropping Prone</h2><section class="fvtt advice"><figure

        size category, which determines the width of the square space the
        creature occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size and Space
        table. That table lists the sizes from smallest (Tiny) to largest
        (Gargantuan). A creature’s space is the area that it effectively
        controls in combat and the area it needs to fight effectively.</p><p>A

        <p>A melee attack allows you to attack a target within your reach. A
        melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon or an
        &amp;Reference[Unarmed Strike]. Many monsters make melee attacks with
        claws, teeth, or other body parts. A few spells also involve melee
        attacks.</p><h2>Reach</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbAppendixDRule.JournalEntryPage.hgZ5ZN4B3y7tmFlt
        inline]</p><h2>Opportunity Attacks</h2><p>Combatants watch for enemies
        to drop their guard. If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put
        yourself in danger by provoking an Opportunity
        Attack.</p><p><em><strong>Avoiding Opportunity Attacks.</strong></em>
        You can avoid provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the Disengage
        action. You also don’t provoke an Opportunity Attack when you Teleport
        or when you are moved without using your movement, action, Bonus Action,
        or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an Opportunity Attack if an
        explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an
        enemy.</p><p><em><strong>Making an Opportunity Attack.</strong></em> You
        can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves
        your reach. To make the attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack
        with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack
        occurs right before it leaves your reach.</p>
