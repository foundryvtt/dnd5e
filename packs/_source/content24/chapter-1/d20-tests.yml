        <p>When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a d20 roll
        to determine success or failure. These rolls are called
        &amp;Reference[d20test]{D20 Tests}, and they come in three kinds:
        ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. They follow these
        steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Roll 1d20.</strong> You always want to roll
        high. If the roll has &amp;Reference[advantage] or
        &amp;Reference[disadvantage], you roll two d20s, but you use the number
        from only one of them—the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower
        one if you have Disadvantage.</li><li><p><strong>Add Modifiers.</strong>
        Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:</p><ul><li
        class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-2"><strong>The Relevant
        Ability Modifier.</strong> This chapter and the rules glossary explain
        which ability modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.</li><li
        class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-2"><strong>Your
        Proficiency Bonus If Relevant. </strong>Each creature has a Proficiency
        Bonus, a number added when making a D20 Test that uses something, such
        as a skill, in which the creature has proficiency. See
        @UUID[.zU9fgQbLaVbJvPRX]{Proficiency} later in this chapter.</li><li
        class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted ParaOverride-2"><strong>Circumstantial
        Bonuses and Penalties.</strong> A class feature, a spell, or another
        rule might give a bonus or penalty to the die
        roll.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Compare the Total to a Target
        Number.</strong> If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or
        exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails.
        The Game Master determines target numbers and tells players whether
        their rolls are successful. The target number for an ability check or a
        saving throw is called a &amp;Reference[difficultyclass] (DC). The
        target number for an attack roll is called an &amp;Reference[armorclass]
        (AC), which appears on a character sheet or in a stat block.</li></ol>

      content: "<p>An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.</p><h2>Ability Modifier</h2><p>An &amp;Reference[abilitycheck] is named for the ability modifier it uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so on. Different ability checks are called for in different situations, depending on which ability is most relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for examples of each check’s use.</p><table><caption>Ability Check Examples</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Ability</p></th><th><p>Make a Check To …</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Strength</p></td><td><p>Lift, push, pull, or break something</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dexterity</p></td><td><p>Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Constitution</p></td><td><p>Push your body beyond normal limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intelligence</p></td><td><p>Reason or remember</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Wisdom</p></td><td><p>Notice things in the environment or in creatures’ behavior</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Charisma</p></td><td><p>Influence, entertain, or deceive</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2><p>Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check when the GM determines that a skill or tool proficiency is relevant to the check and you have that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See @UUID[.zU9fgQbLaVbJvPRX]{Proficiency} later in this chapter for more information about skill and tool proficiencies.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Inline Ability Checks</h3><p>Ability checks in Foundry can be handled with a click.

        <p>An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target. An attack
        roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the target’s
        &amp;Reference[armorclass]. Attack rolls usually occur in battle,
        described in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCombat0000000]{Combat}
        later in this chapter, but the GM might also ask for an attack roll in
        other situations, such as an archery competition.</p><h2>Ability
        Modifier</h2><p>The &amp;Reference[attackrolls] Abilities table shows
        which ability modifier to use for different types of attack
        rolls.</p><table><caption>Attack Roll
        Abilities</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Ability</p></th><th><p>Attack
        Type</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Strength</p></td><td><p>Melee
        attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike (see the rules

        7})</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Some features let you use different
        ability modifiers from those listed. For example, the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000.JournalEntryPage.7qSj8lqMAP0FBNKK#finesse]{Finesse
        property} (see
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000.JournalEntryPage.7qSj8lqMAP0FBNKK#finesse]{Equipment})
        lets you use Strength or Dexterity with a weapon that has that
        property.</p><h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2><p>You add your Proficiency Bonus
        to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon you have proficiency
        with, as well as when you attack with a spell. See
        @UUID[.zU9fgQbLaVbJvPRX]{Proficiency} later in this chapter for more
        information about weapon proficiencies.</p><h2>Armor Class</h2><p>A
        creature’s Armor Class represents how well the creature avoids being
        wounded in combat. The AC of a character is determined at
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCreatingAChar.JournalEntryPage.l4eqkEUGLVS2jBhO]{character
        creation}, whereas the AC of a monster appears in its stat
        block.</p><p><em><strong>Calculating AC.</strong></em> All creatures
        start with the same base AC calculation:</p><p
        style="text-align:center"><strong>Base AC</strong> = 10 + the creature’s
        Dexterity modifier</p><p>A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor,
        magic items, spells, and more.</p><p><em><strong>Only One Base
        AC.</strong></em> Some spells and class features give characters a
        different way to calculate their AC. A character with multiple features
        that give different ways to calculate AC must choose which one to use;
        only one base calculation can be in effect for a
        creature.</p><h2>Rolling 20 or 1</h2><p>If you roll a 20 on the d20
        (called a “natural 20”) for an attack roll, the attack hits regardless
        of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a
        &amp;Reference[Critical Hits]{Critical Hit} (see
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCombat0000000]{Combat}
        later in this chapter).</p><p>If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”)
        for an attack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the
        target’s AC.</p>

        <p>Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage or Disadvantage.
        Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll,
        while Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.</p><p>You usually
        acquire Advantage or Disadvantage through the use of special abilities
        and actions. The GM can also decide that circumstances grant Advantage
        or impose Disadvantage.</p><h2>Roll Two D20s</h2><p>When a roll has
        either Advantage or Disadvantage, roll a second d20 when you make the
        roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and use the
        lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For example, if you have
        Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a 3, use the 3. If you instead have
        Advantage and roll those numbers, use the 18.</p><h2>They Don’t
        Stack</h2><p>If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant
        Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Similarly, if multiple
        situations impose Disadvantage on a roll, you roll only two
        d20s.</p><p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage and
        Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them, and you roll one d20. This
        is true even if multiple circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one
        grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither
        Advantage nor Disadvantage.</p><h2>Interactions with Rerolls</h2><p>When
        you have Advantage or Disadvantage and something in the game lets you
        reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not
        both. You choose which one.</p><p>For example, if you have
        &amp;Reference[inspiration]{Heroic Inspiration} (see below) and roll a 3
        and an 18 on an ability check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you
        could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one of those dice, not
        both of them.</p><aside class="notable"><h3>Heroic
        Inspiration</h3><p>Sometimes the GM or a rule gives you Heroic
        Inspiration. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll
        any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new
        roll.</p><p><em><strong>Only One at a Time.</strong></em> You can never
        have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something gives
        you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, you can give it to a
        player character in your group who lacks it.</p><p><em><strong>Gaining
        Heroic Inspiration.</strong></em> Your GM can give you Heroic
        Inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you
        do something particularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It’s a
        reward for making the game more fun for everyone playing.</p><p>Other
        rules might allow your character to gain Heroic Inspiration independent
        of the DM’s decision. For example, Human characters start each day with
        Heroic Inspiration.</p></aside><section class="fvtt advice"><figure

        <p>Characters and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled
        with many weapons, while others can use only a few. Some are better at
        understanding people’s motives, and others are better at unlocking the
        secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which
        reflects the impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities. A
        character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels
        (described in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCreatingAChar.JournalEntryPage.iHbj5aJvc1T7i5YI]{chapter
        2}). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its
        &amp;Reference[challengerating]. The Proficiency Bonus table shows how
        the bonus is determined.</p><p>This bonus is applied to a
        &amp;Reference[d20test] when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in
        a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the D20
        Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the
        DC of saving throws for spells.</p><table><caption>Proficiency
        Bonus</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Level or
        CR</p></th><th><p>Bonus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Up to
        4</p></td><td><p>+2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5–8</p></td><td><p>+3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9–12</p></td><td><p>+4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13–16</p></td><td><p>+5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17–20</p></td><td><p>+6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>21–24</p></td><td><p>+7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>25–28</p></td><td><p>+8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>29–30</p></td><td><p>+9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>The
        Bonus Doesn’t Stack</h2><p>Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a
        die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows
        you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your
        Proficiency Bonus if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t
        add it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.</p><p>Occasionally, a
        Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for
        example) before being added. For example, the &amp;Reference[expertise]
        feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks.
        Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided
        only once.</p><h2>Skill Proficiencies</h2><p>Most ability checks involve
        using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do
        with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbActions000000]{Actions}
        later in this chapter) specify which skill applies if you make an
        ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is
        relevant. The GM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in
        a situation.</p><p>If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature
        applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill.
        Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks
        involving that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For example,
        if a character tries to climb a cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength
        (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the
        character adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. If the
        character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding
        their Proficiency
        Bonus.</p><table><caption>Skills</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Skill</p></th><th><p>Ability</p></th><th><p>Example

        are shown on the Skills table, which notes example uses for each skill
        proficiency as well as the ability check the skill most often applies
        to.</p><h3>Determining Skills</h3><p>A character’s starting skill
        proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s
        skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.</p><h2>Saving Throw
        Proficiencies</h2><p>Proficiency in a &amp;Reference[savingthrow] lets a
        character add their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a particular
        ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom saves lets you add your
        Proficiency Bonus to your Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving
        throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.</p><p>Each class
        gives proficiency in at least two saving throws, representing that
        class’s training in evading or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for
        example, are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves; they train to
        resist mental assault.</p><h2>Equipment Proficiencies</h2><p>A character
        gains proficiency with various weapons and tools from their class and
        background. There are two categories of equipment
        proficiency:</p><p><strong>Weapons.</strong> Anyone can wield a weapon,
        but proficiency makes you better at wielding it. If you have proficiency
        with a weapon, you add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls you make
        with it.</p><p><strong>Tools.</strong> If you have proficiency with a
        tool, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make
        that uses the tool. If you have Proficiency in the skill that’s also
        used with that check, you have &amp;Reference[advantage] on the check
        too. This means you can benefit from both skill proficiency and tool
        proficiency on the same ability check.</p>
