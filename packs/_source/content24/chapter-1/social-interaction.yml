        <p>During their adventures, player characters meet many different people
        and face some monsters that would rather talk than fight. In those
        situations, it’s time for social interaction, which takes many forms.
        For example, you might try to convince a burglar to confess to
        wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The Game Master assumes the roles
        of any nonplayer characters who are participating.</p><p>An NPC’s
        attitude toward your character is &amp;Reference[Friendly],
        &amp;Reference[Indifferent], or &amp;Reference[Hostile]. Friendly NPCs
        are predisposed to help, and Hostile ones are inclined to
        hinder.</p><p>Social interactions progress in two ways: through
        roleplaying and ability checks.</p>

        <p>Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this
        case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts,
        and talks. Roleplaying is part of every aspect of the game, and it comes
        to the fore during social interactions.</p><p>As you roleplay, consider
        whether you prefer an active approach or a descriptive approach, each of
        which is described in Social Interaction Example.</p><p>The GM uses an
        NPC’s personality and your character’s actions and attitudes to
        determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under
        threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant refuses to help if the
        characters badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.</p><p>When
        interacting with an NPC, pay attention to the DM’s portrayal of the
        NPC’s personality. You might be able to learn an NPC’s goals and then
        use that information to influence the NPC.</p><p>If you offer NPCs
        something they want or play on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you
        can form friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece of
        information. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak
        ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will likely
        fail.</p>

        <p>Ability checks can be key in determining the outcome of a social
        interaction. Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but
        there might still be an element of chance if the GM wants dice to play a
        role in determining an NPC’s response to you. In such situations, the DM
        will typically ask you to take the &amp;Reference[Influence]
        action.</p><p>Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of
        how you will interact with an NPC; use an approach that relies on your
        group’s skill proficiencies. For example, if the group needs to trick a
        guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue who is proficient in
        Deception should lead the discussion.</p>
