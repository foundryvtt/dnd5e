        <p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are a favorite tool
        among assassins and evil creatures.</p><p>Poisons come in the following
        four types:</p><p><strong>Contact.</strong> Contact poison can be
        smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed
        off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers
        its effects.</p><p><strong>Ingested.</strong> A creature must swallow an
        entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be
        delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a
        reduced effect, such as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or
        dealing only half as much damage on a failed
        save.</p><p><strong>Inhaled.</strong> Poisonous powders and gases take
        effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects
        creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates
        immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against
        inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other
        parts of the body.</p><p><strong>Injury.</strong> Injury poison can be
        applied as a Bonus Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or similar
        object. The poison remains potent until delivered through a wound or
        washed off. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from an
        object coated with the poison is exposed to its
        effects.</p><h2>Purchasing Poison</h2><p>In some settings, laws prohibit
        the possession and use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous
        apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts
        might be able to acquire poison easily. Other characters might have to
        make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire the poison
        they seek.</p><h2>Harvesting Poison</h2><p>A character can attempt to
        harvest poison from a venomous creature that is dead or has the
        Incapacitated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after which the
        character makes a [[/check 20 nature]] check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On
        a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single
        dose, and no additional poison can be harvested from that creature. On a
        failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the
        character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to
        the creature’s poison.</p><h2>Sample Poisons</h2><p>Example poisons are
        detailed here in alphabetical order. Each poison's description includes
        the suggested price for a single dose of the poison, its type (contact,
        ingested, inhaled, or injury), and a description of the poison's
        debilitating effects.</p><hr

        <p>Traps should be used sparingly, lest they lose their charm. A hidden
        pit can be a fun surprise, but too many traps in an adventure can lead
        players to become overly cautious, which slows down the game.</p><p>The
        best traps are fleeting distractions that skilled characters can
        overcome in a short amount of time or deadly puzzles that require quick
        thinking and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are undetectable and
        inescapable are rarely fun.</p><h2>Parts of a Trap</h2><p>The
        description of a trap includes the following parts after the trap’s
        name:</p><p><strong>Severity and Levels.</strong> A trap is designated
        as a nuisance or as deadly for characters of certain levels. A nuisance
        trap is unlikely to seriously harm characters of the indicated levels,
        whereas a deadly trap can grievously damage characters of the indicated
        levels.</p><p><strong>Trigger.</strong> Traps are often set to go off
        when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Examples of
        triggers include stepping on a pressure plate, crossing a trip wire,
        turning a doorknob, or using the wrong key in a
        lock.</p><p><strong>Duration. </strong>Some traps have durations
        expressed in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that their
        effects last until the trap is destroyed or dispelled. If a trap’s
        duration is instantaneous, its effect is resolved instantly. If a trap
        resets after activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is
        otherwise inert after activation.</p><p>Use caution when introducing a
        trap to characters of a level lower than the trap’s level range. A trap
        that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly to characters of a
        lower level range.</p><h2>Example Traps</h2><p>Traps are presented in
        alphabetical order.</p><hr

        <p>A group of characters can travel overland at a Normal, Fast, or Slow
        pace, as described in Playing the Game. During any journey stage, the
        predominant terrain determines the characters’ maximum travel pace, as
        shown in the Maximum Pace column of the Travel Terrain table below.
        Certain factors can affect a group’s travel pace.</p><p><em><strong>Good
        Roads.</strong></em> The presence of a good road increases the group’s
        maximum pace by one step (from Slow to Normal or from Normal to
        Fast).</p><p><em><strong>Slower Travelers.</strong></em> The group must
        move at a Slow pace if any group member’s Speed is reduced to half or
        less of normal.</p><p><em><strong>Extended Travel.</strong></em>
        Characters can push themselves to travel for more than 8 hours per day,
        at the risk of tiring. At the end of each additional hour of travel
        beyond 8 hours, each character must succeed on a [[/save con]] saving
        throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 10 plus 1 for each hour past
        8 hours.</p><p><em><strong>Special Movement.</strong></em> If a party
        can travel at a high Speed for an extended time, as with a spell such as
        <em>Wind Walk</em> or a magic item such as a <em>Carpet of Flying</em>,
        translate the party’s Speed into travel rates using these rules:</p><p
        class="List-Styles_List-Item-Centered"
        style="text-align:center"><strong>Miles per hour</strong> = Speed ÷
        10</p><p class="List-Styles_List-Item-Centered"
        style="text-align:center"><strong>Miles per day</strong> (Normal pace) =
        Miles per hour <br />× number of hours traveled (typically 8)</p><p
        class="List-Styles_List-Item-Centered"
        style="text-align:center"><strong>Fast pace</strong> = Miles per day ×
        1⅓ (round down)</p><p class="List-Styles_List-Item-Centered"
        style="text-align:center"><strong>Slow pace</strong> = Miles per day ×
        2/3 (round down)</p><p>If the characters are flying or their special
        movement allows them to ignore &amp;Reference[Difficult Terrain], they
        can move at a Fast pace regardless of the
        terrain.</p><p><em><strong>Vehicles.</strong></em> Characters traveling
        in a vehicle use the vehicle’s speed in miles per hour (as shown in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000]{Equipment})
        to determine their rate of travel, and they don’t choose a travel

        <p>A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified time or until
        it is ended by some means. A magical contagion is an adverse effect of
        magical origin that is contagious by definition.</p><p>The following
        sections discuss curses and magical contagions in
        detail.</p><h2>Curses</h2><p>A curse typically takes one of the forms
        detailed below.</p><h3>Bestow Curse</h3><p>The simplest curses are
        created by the <em>Bestow Curse</em> spell. The effects of such curses
        are limited and can be ended by the <em>Remove Curse
        </em>spell.</p><p><em>Bestow Curse</em> provides useful benchmarks for
        gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that lasts for 1 minute
        equates to a level 3 spell, while one that lasts until dispelled equates
        to a level 9 spell.</p><h3>Cursed Creatures</h3><p>Some monsters are
        associated with curses, whether as part of their origins or due to their
        ability to spread curses—werewolves being a prime example.</p><p>You
        decide how a spell like <em>Remove Curse</em> affects a creature with
        accursed origins. For example, you might decide that a mummy was created
        through a curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by casting
        <em>Remove Curse</em> on its corpse.</p><h3>Cursed Magic
        Items</h3><p>Cursed magic items are created deliberately or originate as
        the result of supernatural events. Such items are detailed in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgMagicItemList.JournalEntryPage.epDAUqo0kTTrTpYR]{Magic
        Items}.</p><h3>Narrative Curses</h3><p>A curse might manifest during an
        adventure when a creature’s violation of a taboo warrants supernatural
        punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a tomb, or murdering an
        innocent. Such a curse can have any effects you design, or it might be a
        customized version of another type of curse discussed in this
        section.</p><p>A creature affected by such a curse should know why
        they’re being punished and be able to learn how to end their curse,
        likely by symbolically righting the wrong they committed. How a spell
        like <em>Remove Curse</em> affects a curse that’s part of your adventure
        is up to you—the spell might merely suppress the effects of the curse
        for a time. Regardless, narrative curses should feel like rare, potent
        magic rooted in the lore of your campaign.</p><h3>Environmental
        Curses</h3><p>Some locations are so suffused with evil that anyone who
        lingers there is burdened with a curse. Demonic Possession is one
        example of an environmental curse.</p><p><em><strong>Demonic
        Possession.</strong></em> Demonic Possession arises from the chaos and
        evil of the Abyss and commonly besets creatures that interact with
        demonic objects or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic spirits
        await victims.</p><p>A creature that becomes the target of Demonic
        Possession must succeed on a [[/save cha 15]] saving throw or be
        possessed by a bodiless demonic entity. Whenever the possessed creature
        rolls a 1 on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of the
        creature and determines the creature’s behavior thereafter. At the end
        of each of the possessed creature’s later turns, the creature makes a
        [[/save cha 15]] saving throw, regaining control of itself on a
        success.</p><p class="_idGenParaOverride-1">After finishing a Long Rest,
        a creature with Demonic Possession makes a [[/save cha 15]] saving
        throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the creature. A
        <em>Dispel Evil and Good </em>spell or any magic that removes a curse
        also ends the effect on it.</p><h2>Magical Contagions</h2><p>Alchemists,
        potion brewers, and areas of wild magic are credited with creating the
        first magical contagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form the
        basis of an adventure as characters search for a cure and try to stop
        the contagion’s spread.</p><h3>Rest and Recuperation</h3><p>If a
        creature infected with a magical contagion spends 3 days
        recuperating—engaging in no activities that would interrupt a Long
        Rest—the creature makes a [[/save con 15]] saving throw at the end of
        the recuperation period. On a successful save, the creature has
        Advantage on saving throws to fight off the magical contagion for the
        next 24 hours.</p><h3>Example Contagions</h3><p>The following examples
        show how magical contagions can work. Feel free to alter the saving
        throw DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these contagions to
        suit your campaign.</p><hr /><h4>Cackle Fever</h4><p><em>Magical
        Contagion</em></p><p>Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes
        tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids only (gnomes are
        strangely immune). A creature suffers the following effects [[/r 1d4]]
        days after infection:</p><p><strong>Fever.</strong> The creature gains 1
        Exhaustion level, which lasts until the contagion ends on the
        creature.</p><p><strong>Uncontrollable Laughter.</strong> While the
        creature has the &amp;Reference[Exhaustion] condition, the creature
        makes a[[/save con 13]] saving throw each time it takes damage other
        than Psychic damage. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/damage 1d10
        psychic average]] damage and has the &amp;Reference[Incapacitated]
        condition as it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its turns,
        the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.</p><p><em><strong>Fighting
        the Contagion.</strong></em> At the end of each Long Rest, an infected
        creature makes a [[/save con 13]] saving throw. After the creature
        succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and the
        creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1
        year.</p><p><em><strong>Spreading the Contagion.</strong></em> Any
        Humanoid (other than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot
        Emanation originating from a creature infected with Cackle Fever must
        succeed on a [[/save con 10]] saving throw or also become infected with
        the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t catch the
        contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24
        hours.</p><hr /><h4>Sewer Plague</h4><p><em>Magical
        Contagion</em></p><p>Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise
        to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and refuse heaps and is
        sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in such areas, including
        otyughs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a creature that
        carries the contagion or that comes into contact with contaminated filth
        or offal must succeed on a [[/save con 11]] saving throw or become
        infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers the following effects
        [[/r 1d4]] days after infection:</p><p><strong>Fatigue.</strong> The
        creature gains 1 &amp;Reference[Exhaustion]
        level.</p><p><strong>Weakness.</strong> While the creature has any
        Exhaustion levels, it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points
        from spending Hit Point Dice.</p><p><strong>Restlessness.</strong> While
        the creature has any Exhaustion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither
        restores lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature’s Exhaustion
        level.</p><p><em><strong>Fighting the Contagion.</strong></em> Daily at
        dawn, an infected creature makes a [[/save con 11]] saving throw. On a
        failed save, the creature gains 1 Exhaustion level as its fatigue
        worsens. On a successful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases
        by 1. If the creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion
        ends on the creature.</p><hr /><h4>Sight Rot</h4><p><em>Magical
        Contagion</em></p><p>Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted by
        Sight Rot must succeed on a [[/save con 15]] saving throw or have the
        &amp;Reference[Blinded] condition until the contagion
        ends.</p><p><em><strong>Fighting the Contagion.</strong></em> Magic such
        as a <em>Heal</em> or <em>Lesser Restoration</em> spell ends the
        contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an Herbalism
        Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1
        hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot,
        the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If
        the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours
        (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion
        ends on the creature.</p><p><em><strong>Spreading the
        Contagion.</strong></em> Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a
        creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a [[/save con 15]]
        saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful
        save, the Humanoid can’t catch the contagion from that particular
        infected creature for the next 24 hours.</p><hr />

        <h2>Deep Water</h2><p>Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet
        deep) presents additional challenges because of the water’s pressure and
        cold temperature. After each hour of swimming in deep water, a creature
        that lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a [[/save con 10]] saving throw
        or gain 1 &amp;Reference[Exhaustion] level.</p><h2>Extreme
        Cold</h2><p>When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a
        creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a [[/save con 10]]
        saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1
        &amp;Reference[Exhaustion] level. Creatures that have Resistance or
        Immunity to Cold damage automatically succeed on the
        save.</p><h2>Extreme Heat</h2><p>When the temperature is 100 degrees
        Fahrenheit or higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and without
        access to drinkable water must succeed on a [[/save con]] saving throw
        at the end of each hour or gain 1 &amp;Reference[Exhaustion] level. The
        DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.
        Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have Disadvantage on the save.
        Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically
        succeed on the save.</p><h2>Frigid Water</h2><p>A creature can be
        immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its
        Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional
        minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a
        [[/save con 10]] saving throw or gain 1 &amp;Reference[Exhaustion]
        level. Creatures with Resistance or Immunity to Cold damage
        automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally
        adapted to living in ice-cold water.</p><h2>Heavy
        Precipitation</h2><p>Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy
        snowfall is &amp;Reference[Lightly Obscured], and creatures in the area
        have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks. Heavy rain also
        extinguishes open flames.</p><h2>High Altitude</h2><p>Traveling at
        altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for most
        creatures because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour
        such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for
        the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel (see
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbExploration00.JournalEntryPage.LxNKnBjL1rx6MQUO]{Travel
        Pace}).</p><p>Creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by
        spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Creatures can’t become
        acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to
        such environments.</p><h2>Slippery Ice</h2><p>Slippery ice is
        &amp;Reference[Difficult Terrain]. A creature that moves onto slippery
        ice for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed
        on a [[/save dex 10]] saving throw or have the &amp;Reference[Prone]
        condition.</p><h2>Strong Wind</h2><p>Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on
        ranged attack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open flames and
        disperses fog. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end
        of its turn or fall.</p><p>A strong wind in a desert can create a
        sandstorm that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
        checks.</p><h2>Thin Ice</h2><p>Thin ice has a weight tolerance of [[/r
        3d10*10]]{3d10 × 10} pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total
        weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that
        area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through. Below the ice is
        frigid water (see @UUID[.xgLA30rErlkjIPAK#frigid-water]{Frigid Water}
        above).</p>

        <p>Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers tend to be less
        susceptible to fear and mental stress than common folk. Whereas a farmer
        might flee in terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are made
        of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures and game effects can
        terrify or fray the mind of even the most stalwart adventurer.</p><p>If
        you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them with your players at
        the start of the campaign.</p><h2>Fear Effects</h2><p>Whenever the
        characters encounter something that is supernaturally frightful, use the
        &amp;Reference[Frightened] condition as the baseline effect. Fear
        effects typically require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC based on
        how terrifying the situation is. The Sample Fear DCs table provides some
        examples.</p><table><caption>Sample Fear
        DCs</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Example</p></th><th><p>Save
        DC</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>When the characters open a
        sarcophagus, a harmless yet terrifying apparition
        appears.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 10]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A
        character triggers a magical trap that creates an illusory manifestation
        of that character’s worst fears, visible only to that
        character.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 15]]</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A
        portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a nightmarish realm of torment and
        slaughter.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis
        20]]</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Typically, a Frightened creature
        repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
        effect on itself on a success.</p><p>At your discretion, a Frightened
        creature might be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened
        condition lasts. Consider these examples:</p><ul><li
        class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted">The Frightened creature must take the
        Dash action on each of its turns and uses its movement to get farther
        away from the source of its fear.</li><li
        class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted">Attack rolls against the Frightened
        creature have Advantage.</li><li class="Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted">The
        Frightened creature can do only one of the following on each of its
        turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.</li></ul><h2>Mental
        Stress Effects</h2><p>When a character is subjected to an effect that
        causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the best way to emulate
        that effect.</p><p>The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a few
        examples of such effects, with suggested saving throw DCs and damage.
        Mental stress can usually be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but
        sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more appropriate. On a
        successful save, a character might take half as much damage instead of
        no damage, at your discretion.</p><table><caption>Sample Mental Stress
        Effects</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Example</p></th><th><p>Save
        DC</p></th><th><p>Psychic
        Damage</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>A character ingests a
        hallucinogenic substance that distorts the character’s perception of
        reality.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 10]]</p></td><td><p>[[/damage 1d6
        type=psychic]]{1d6}</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A character touches a
        <span>fiendish</span> idol that tears at the character’s mind,
        threatening to shatter it.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis
        15]]</p></td><td><p>[[/damage 3d6
        type=psychic]]{3d6}</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A magical trap flings a
        character into the Far Realm until the end of that character’s next
        turn.</p></td><td><p>[[/save wis 20]]</p></td><td><p>[[/damage 9d6
        type=psychic]]{9d6}</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Prolonged
        Effects</h3><p>Exposure to mental stress can cause prolonged effects.
        Consider the following possibilities.</p><p><em><strong>Short-Term
        Effects.</strong></em> The character has the &amp;Reference[Frightened],
        &amp;Reference[Incapacitated], or &amp;Reference[Stunned] condition for
        1d10 minutes. This condition might be accompanied by alarming behavior
        or hallucinations. These effects can be suppressed with the <em>Calm
        Emotions</em> spell or removed by the <em>Lesser Restoration</em>
        spell.</p><p><em><strong>Long-Term Effects.</strong></em> The character
        has Disadvantage on some or all ability checks for [[/r 1d10*10]]{1d10 ×
        10} hours, stemming from an unwillingness or inability to exert a
        particular set of abilities. The character might feel enervated and
        unable to exert much Strength, for example, or become so suspicious of
        others that Charisma checks are more difficult. These effects can be
        suppressed with the <em>Calm Emotions</em> spell or removed by the
        <em>Lesser Restoration</em> spell.</p><p><em><strong>Indefinite
        Effects.</strong></em> An indefinite effect is a long-term effect (see
        above) that lasts until removed by a <em>Greater Restoration</em> spell.
        It can be suppressed by a <em>Calm Emotions</em> spell.</p>

        <p>The following features can make a combat encounter more interesting
        or challenging:</p><p><strong>Changes in Elevation.</strong> Terrain
        features that provide a change of elevation (such as stacks of empty
        crates, ledges, and balconies) reward clever positioning and encourage
        characters to jump, climb, fly, or teleport.</p><p><strong>Defensive
        Positions.</strong> Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive

        around.</p><p><strong>Mixed Monster Groups.</strong> When different

        class="header" data-anchor="combat-encounter-difficulty">Combat
        Encounter Difficulty</h2><p>Use the following guidelines to create a
        combat encounter of a desired level of
        difficulty.</p><p><em><strong>Step 1: Choose a Difficulty.</strong></em>
        Three categories describe the range of encounter
        difficulty:</p><p><strong>Low Difficulty.</strong> An encounter of low
        difficulty is likely to have one or two scary moments for the players,
        but their characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or
        more of them might need to use healing resources, however. As a rough
        guideline, a single monster generally presents a low-difficulty
        challenge for a party of four characters whose level equals the
        monster’s Challenge Rating.</p><p><strong>Moderate Difficulty.</strong>
        Absent healing and other resources, an encounter of moderate difficulty
        could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken
        out of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters
        might die.</p><p><strong>High Difficulty.</strong> A high-difficulty
        encounter could be lethal for one or more characters. To survive it, the
        characters will need smart tactics, quick thinking, and maybe even a
        little luck.</p><p><em><strong>Step 2: Determine Your XP
        Budget.</strong></em> Using the XP Budget per Character table,
        cross-reference the party’s level with the desired encounter difficulty.
        Multiply the number in the table by the number of characters in the
        party to get your XP budget for the encounter.</p><table><caption>XP

        3: Spend Your Budget.</strong></em> Every creature has an XP value in
        its stat block. When you add a creature to your combat encounter, deduct
        its XP from your XP budget to determine how many XP you have left to
        spend. Spend as much of your XP budget as you can without going over.
        It’s OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples are given
        below:</p><p><strong>Example 1.</strong> A low-difficulty encounter for
        four level 1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total of 200
        XP. With that, you could build any of the following
        encounters:</p><ul><li class="List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted">1
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmBugbearWarrior]{Bugbear
        Warrior}</strong> (200 XP)</li><li
        class="List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted">2
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGiantWasp00000]{Giant
        Wasps}</strong> (100 XP each), for 200 XP total</li><li
        class="List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted">6
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmGiantRat000000]{Giant
        Rats}</strong> (25 XP each), for 150 XP
        total</li></ul><p><strong>Example 2.</strong> A moderate-difficulty
        encounter for five level 3 characters has an XP budget of 225 × 5, for a
        total of 1,125 XP. With that, you could build either of these
        encounters:</p><ul><li class="List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted">2
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmDruid000000000]{Druids}</strong>
        (450 XP each) and 9
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmStirge00000000]{Stirges}</strong>
        (25 XP each), for 1,125 XP total</li><li
        class="List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted">1
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWight000000000]{Wight}</strong>
        (700 XP), 1
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmWarhorseSkelet]{Warhorse
        Skeleton}</strong> (100 XP), and 6
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmSkeleton000000]{Skeletons}</strong>
        (50 XP each), for 1,100 XP total</li></ul><p><strong>Example 3.</strong>
        A high-difficulty encounter for six level 15 characters has an XP budget
        of 7,800 × 6, for a total of 46,800 XP. With that, you could build this
        encounter:</p><ul><li class="List-Styles_List-Item-Bulleted">2
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmAdultRedDragon]{Adult
        Red Dragons}</strong> (18,000 XP each) and 2
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.actors24.Actor.mmFireGiant00000]{Fire
        Giants} </strong>(5,000 XP each), for 46,000 XP
        total</li></ul><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>When creating and running
        combat encounters, keep the following in mind.</p><p><em><strong>Many
        Creatures.</strong></em> The more creatures in an encounter, the higher
        the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal more damage to the
        characters than you expect. If your encounter includes more than two
        creatures per character, include fragile creatures that can be defeated
        quickly. This guideline is especially important for characters of level
        1 or 2.</p><p><em><strong>Adjustments.</strong></em> A player’s absence
        might warrant removing creatures from an encounter to keep it at the
        intended difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result in an
        encounter being easier or harder than intended. You can adjust an
        encounter on the fly, such as by having creatures flee (making the
        encounter easier) or adding reinforcements (making the encounter
        harder).</p><p><em><strong>CR 0 Creatures.</strong></em> Creatures that
        have a CR of 0, particularly ones that are worth 0 XP, should be used
        sparingly. If you want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter,
        use swarms<em> </em>instead.</p><p><em><strong>Number of Stat
        Blocks.</strong></em> The best combat encounters often pair one kind of
        creature with another, such as fire giants paired with hell hounds. Be
        mindful of the number of stat blocks you need to run the encounter.
        Referencing more than two or three stat blocks for a single encounter
        can be daunting, particularly if the creatures are
        complex.</p><p><em><strong>Powerful Creatures.</strong></em> If your
        combat encounter includes a creature whose CR is higher than the party’s
        level, be aware that such a creature might deal enough damage with a
        single action to take out one or more characters. For example, an
        <strong>Ogre</strong> (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard with a single
        blow.</p><p><em><strong>Unusual Features.</strong></em> If a monster has
        a feature that lower-level characters can’t easily overcome, consider
        not adding that monster to an encounter for characters whose level is
        lower than the monster’s Challenge Rating.</p>
