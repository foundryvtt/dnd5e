        <p>Your character’s background is a collection of characteristics that
        represent the place and occupation that were most formative before your
        character embarked on a life of adventure.</p><p>Explore available
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbBackgroundDes.JournalEntryPage.lXqvtf9mIp8RYjFr]{backgrounds}.</p><h2>Parts
        of a Background</h2><p>A background includes the following
        parts.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Scores.</strong></em> A background
        lists three of your character’s ability scores. Increase one by 2 and
        another one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases
        can raise a score above 20.</p><p><em><strong>Feat.</strong></em> A
        background gives your character a specified Origin feat (described in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbFeats00000000]{Feats}).</p><p><em><strong>Skill

        proficiency in two specified skills.</p><p><em><strong>Tool
        Proficiency.</strong></em> Each background gives a character proficiency
        with one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen from the Artisan’s
        Tools category. Tools are detailed in chapter
        6.</p><p><em><strong>Equipment.</strong></em> Each background offers a
        choice between a package of equipment and 50 GP.</p>

        <p>When you choose your character’s species, you determine whether your
        character is a human or a member of a fantastical species, such as
        dragonborn or gnome.</p><p>The peoples of the D&amp;D multiverse hail
        from different worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms. A
        player character’s species is the set of game traits that an adventurer
        gains from being one of those life forms.</p><p>Some species can trace
        their origin to a single world, plane of existence, or god, while other
        species first appeared in multiple realms at once. Whatever a species’
        genesis, its members have spread across the multiverse and contribute to
        many different cultures.</p><p>Members of most species live for about 80
        years, with exceptions noted in the text about the species in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbSpeciesDescri]{Character
        Origins}. Regardless of life span, members of all species reach physical
        maturity at about the same age. Your character can be any age that isn’t
        beyond their species’ normal life span.</p><h2>Parts of a
        Species</h2><p>A species includes the following
        parts.</p><p><em><strong>Creature Type.</strong></em> A character’s
        species determines the character’s creature type, which is described in
        the rules glossary. Every species in Character Origins is Humanoid;
        playable non-Humanoid species appear in other D&amp;D
        books.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Your character’s species
        determines the character’s size. Individuals within a species cover a
        wide range of heights, and some species include such diversity of size
        that you can choose whether your character is Small or
        Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your character’s species
        determines the character’s Speed.</p><p><em><strong>Special
        Traits.</strong></em> Each species gives a character special
        traits—unique characteristics based on the species’ physiology or
        magical nature. When you choose a species, your character gets all the
        special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a
        handful of options.</p>
