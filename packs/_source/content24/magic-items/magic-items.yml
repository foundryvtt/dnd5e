Unless an armor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must be worn for its magic to function.</p><p>Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If no type is specified, choose the type or determine it randomly.</p><h2>Potions</h2><p>An item in the Potion category might be a magical brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.</p><p><em><strong>Using a Potion.</strong></em> Potions are consumable items. Drinking a potion or administering it to another creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil might take longer as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.</p><p><em><strong>Mixing Potions.</strong></em> A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.</p><p>When a character mixes two potions together, roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgPotionMiscibi rollable]</p><h2>Rings</h2><p>For its magic to function, an item in the Ring category must be worn on a finger or a similar digit unless its description notes otherwise.</p><h2>Rods</h2><p>An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs 2 to 5 pounds.</p><p>Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can be used as an Arcane Focus.</p><h2>Scrolls</h2><p>An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is the <em>Spell Scroll</em>, a spell stored in written form. However, some scrolls, like the <em>Scroll of Protection</em>, bear an incantation that isn’t a spell.</p><p><em><strong>Using a Scroll.</strong></em> Scrolls are consumable items. Unleashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it crumbles into dust.</p><p>Any creature that can understand a written language can read a scroll and attempt to activate it unless its description notes otherwise.</p><section class=\"fvtt advice\"><figure class=\"icon\"><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" /></figure><article><h3>Create Scrolls from Spells</h3><p>You can easily create a Scroll for a Spell by right clicking on the spell and selecting the <span class=\"reference\"><em class=\"fa-solid fa-scroll fa-fw\">\_</em> Create Scroll</span> option.</p></article></section><h2>Staffs</h2><p>Items in the Staff category vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and 7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.</p><p>Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane Focus.</p><h2>Wands</h2><p>An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other material.</p><p>Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand can be used as an Arcane Focus.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a weapon from @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000]{Equipment}. Some magic weapons specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no weapon type is specified, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.</p><p><em><strong>Ammunition.</strong></em> If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares whether a weapon is magical or not.</p><h2>Wondrous Items</h2><p>Wondrous Items include wearable items such as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical instruments, and more also fall into this category.</p>"

        <p>Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a rough measure of an
        item’s power relative to other magic items. The rarities are shown in
        the Magic Item Rarities and Values table.</p><p>Common magic items, such
        as a <em>Potion of Healing</em>, are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such
        as the <em>Dragon Orb</em>, are priceless, unique, and difficult to
        acquire.</p><h2>Magic Item Values by Rarity</h2><p>Common magic items
        can often be bought in a town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are
        usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items might be sold only
        in wondrous locations, such as the City of Brass or Sigil. If you allow
        characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, rarity can help
        you set prices for those items. Gold Piece values are provided in the
        Magic Item Rarities and Values table, though a seller might ask for a
        service rather than coin as payment.</p><p>If a magic item incorporates
        an item that has a purchase cost in Equipment (such as a weapon or a
        suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic item’s value. For
        example, <em>+1 Armor</em> (Plate Armor) has a value of 5,500 GP, which
        is the sum of a Rare magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate
        Armor (1,500 GP).</p><table><caption>Magic Item Rarities and
        Values</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Rarity</p></th><th><p>Value*</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Common</p></td><td><p>100
        GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Uncommon</p></td><td><p>400
        GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rare</p></td><td><p>4,000
        GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very Rare</p></td><td><p>40,000
        GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Legendary</p></td><td><p>200,000
        GP</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Artifact</p></td><td><p>Priceless</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>*Halve
        the value for a consumable item other than a <em>Spell Scroll</em>. The
        value of a <em>Spell Scroll</em> is double what it costs to scribe the
        scroll (as specified in the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbCraftingEquip.JournalEntryPage.8hAsl8JueZ3GvyS2]{Scribing
        Spell Scrolls} section of Equipment).</p>

        <p>It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic item. The item’s
        user might also need to do something special. The description of each
        item category or individual item details how an item is activated.
        Certain items use the following rules for their
        activation.</p><h2>Command Word</h2><p>A command word is a word or short
        phrase that must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spoken command
        words must be audible and fail to work in areas where all sound is
        suppressed, as in the area of the <em>Silence</em>
        spell.</p><h2>Consumable Items</h2><p>Some items are consumed—used up,
        in other words—when they are activated. A <em>Potion of Healing</em>
        must be swallowed, for example, while the writing vanishes from a scroll
        when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its
        magic.</p><h2>Spells Cast from Items</h2><p>Some magic items allow the
        user to cast a spell from the item. The spell is cast at the lowest
        possible spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell
        slots, and requires no components unless the item’s description notes
        otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,
        and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires
        Concentration. Many items, such as Potions, bypass the casting of a
        spell and confer the spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain
        items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time,
        duration, or other parts of a spell.</p><p>A magic item may require the
        user to use their own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from the
        item. If the user has more than one spellcasting ability, the user
        chooses which one to use with the item. If the user doesn’t have a
        spellcasting ability, their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the
        item, and the user’s Proficiency Bonus
        applies.</p><h2>Charges</h2><p>Some magic items have charges that must
        be expended to activate their properties. The number of charges an item
        has remaining is revealed when the <em>Identify</em> spell is cast on
        it. A creature attuned to an item knows how many charges the item has
        and how many it regains.</p>

        item.</p><h2>Arcana Proficiency</h2><p>To craft a magic item, you and
        any assistants must have proficiency in the Arcana
        skill.</p><h2>Tools</h2><p>The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool
        is required to make a magic item of each category. You must use the
        required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Any
        assistants must also have proficiency with it. For more information on
        the tools, see Equipment.</p><table><caption>Magic Item

        allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must have all those
        spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.</p><h2>Time and
        Cost</h2><p>Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and money
        based on the item’s rarity as shown in the Magic Item Crafting Time and
        Cost table.</p><p><em><strong>Work per Day.</strong></em> For each day
        of crafting, you must work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple
        days, those days needn’t be
        consecutive.</p><p><em><strong>Assistants.</strong></em> Characters can
        combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time
        needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it.
        Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might
        allow more assistants.</p><p><em><strong>Raw Materials.</strong></em>
        The cost in the table represents the raw materials needed to make a
        magic item. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are
        available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance that the materials
        are available, and in any other settlement, that chance is 25 percent.
        If materials aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before
        checking on the availability again.</p><p>If a magic item incorporates
        an item that has a purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor),
        you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item using the rules in
        Equipment. For example, to make <em>+1 Armor</em> (Plate Armor), you
        must pay 3,500 GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the
        armor.</p><table><caption>Magic Item Crafting Time and

        <p>Some magic items have sentience and personality. Such an item might
        be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware
        thanks to the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be a
        cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the
        side.</p><p>Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds of items
        can manifest sentience. Single-use items such as potions and scrolls are
        never sentient.</p><p>The GM controls sentient magic items and their
        activated properties. A bearer who maintains a good relationship with
        the item can access those properties. If the relationship is strained, a
        conflict can ensue (see @UUID[.AMFpeeVHTKXvGbHA#conflict]{Conflict}
        below).</p><h2>Sentient Magic Item Traits</h2><p>When you make a
        sentient magic item, you create the item’s persona much as you would
        create an NPC, with these
        exceptions.</p><p><em><strong>Abilities.</strong></em> A sentient magic
        item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Choose the item’s
        abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll [[/r 4d6kh3]] for
        each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the
        rest.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> A sentient magic item
        has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment.
        Otherwise, pick an alignment or roll on the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenAlignment0]{Sentient
        Item's Alignment} table.</p><p><em><strong>Communication.</strong></em>
        A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its
        thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it
        communicates or roll on the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenCommunicat]{Sentient
        Item’s Communication} table.</p><p><em><strong>Senses.</strong></em> A
        sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You
        can choose its senses or roll on the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenSenses0000]{Sentient
        Item’s Senses} table.</p><p><em><strong>Special Purpose.</strong></em>
        You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the
        exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns
        with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from
        this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item (see
        Conflict below). You can pick a special purpose or roll on the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenSpecialPur]{Sentient
        Item’s Special Purpose}
        table.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenAlignment0

        rollable]</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.tables24.RollTable.dmgSenSpecialPur
        rollable]</p><h2>Conflict</h2><p>When the bearer of a sentient item acts
        in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can
        arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s bearer makes a Charisma
        saving throw (DC 12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed
        save, the item makes one or more of the following
        demands:</p><p><strong>Chase My Dreams.</strong> The item demands that
        its bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other
        goals.</p><p><strong>Get Rid of It.</strong> The item demands that its
        bearer dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.</p><p><strong>It’s
        Time for a Change.</strong> The item demands to be given to someone
        else.</p><p><strong>Keep Me Close.</strong> The item insists on being
        carried or worn at all times.</p><p>If its bearer refuses to comply with
        the item’s demands, the item can do any of the
        following:</p><ul><li>Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to
        it.</li><li>Suppress one or more of its activated
        properties.</li><li>Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon the
        bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus the item’s Charisma
        modifier). On a failed save, the bearer has the &amp;Reference[Charmed]
        condition for [[/r 1d12]] hours. While Charmed in this way, the bearer
        must try to follow the item’s commands. If the bearer takes damage, it
        repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the
        attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item can’t use this power
        again until the next dawn.</li></ul>
