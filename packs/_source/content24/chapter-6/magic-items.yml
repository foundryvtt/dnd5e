        <p>Adventures hold the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding magic
        items. Hundreds of magic items are detailed in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgMagicItemList]{Magic
        Items}, since the GM decides when you find such an item. Here’s what you
        need to know about using magic items.</p>

        <p>Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical
        counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic
        item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but
        learning a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.</p><p>The
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells24.Item.phbsplIdentify00]{Identify} spell
        is the fastest way to reveal an item’s properties. Alternatively, you
        can focus on one magic item during a Short Rest while being in physical
        contact with the item. At the end of the rest, you learn its properties
        and how to use them (but not any curse the item might
        bear).</p><p>Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties.
        The command word to activate a ring might be etched inside the band, or
        a feathered design might hint that it’s a <em>Ring of Feather
        Falling</em>.</p><p>Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer
        hints about its properties. In the specific case of Potions, a little
        taste is enough to tell the taster what a potion does. Other items might
        require more experimentation. For example, if your character puts on a
        <em>Ring of Swimming</em>, the GM might say, “Your movement feels
        strangely fluid.” Perhaps you then dive into a river to see what
        happens. The GM would then say you swim unexpectedly well.</p>

        <p>Some magic items require a creature to form a bond—called
        Attunement—with them before the creature can use an item’s magical
        properties. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires
        Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description
        states otherwise. For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement
        provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to it,
        but none of its magical properties.</p><h2>Attune during a Short
        Rest</h2><p>Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short Rest
        focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this
        can’t be the same Short Rest used to learn the item’s properties). This
        focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation
        (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is
        interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the
        Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can access its full
        magical capabilities.</p><h2>No More Than Three Items</h2><p>You can be
        attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to
        attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item
        first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than one copy of an item.
        For example, you can’t attune to more than one <em>Ring of
        Protection</em> at a time.</p><h2>Ending Attunement</h2><p>Your
        Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites
        for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at
        least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to the item.
        You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another Short Rest
        focused on the item unless the item is cursed.</p>

        <p>Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A
        magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion:
        boots go on feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, and rings
        on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, a Shield strapped to the arm, a
        cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.</p><p>In most
        cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature
        regardless of size or build. Magic garments are made to be easily
        adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the
        wearer.</p><h2>Multiple Items of the Same Kind</h2><p>You can’t wear
        more than one of certain magic items. You can’t normally wear more than
        one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of
        bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, or one cloak. The DM
        might make exceptions.</p><h2>Paired Items</h2><p>Items that come in
        pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their
        benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a
        character wearing a <em>Boot of Striding and Springing</em> on one foot
        and a <em>Boot of Elvenkind</em> on the other foot gains no benefit from
        either.</p>
