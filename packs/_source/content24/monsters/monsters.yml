        <p>A monster has a stat block that contains the rules necessary to use
        it in the game. Stat blocks are divided into the following
        parts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Name and General Details.</strong> The name
        of the monster is followed by its size, creature type (along with any
        descriptive tags), and alignment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Combat
        Highlights.</strong> Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed, and Initiative are
        provided here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ability Scores.</strong> A
        monster's ability scores, ability modifiers, and saving throws are
        listed here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Details.</strong> The
        monster's Senses, Languages, and CR entries appear here. Additional
        details appear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies,
        Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster lacks those details,
        entries for them don't appear.</p></li><li><p><strong>Traits.</strong>
        Monster characteristics that are active at all times or during certain
        situations appear here.</p></li><li><p><strong>Actions.</strong> The
        monster can take the actions here in addition to those in the

        <p>The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glossary” and in
        this section.</p><h2>Size</h2><p>A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium,
        Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you choose
        the creature’s size from those options. See “Playing the Game” for
        information on size.</p><h2>Creature Type</h2><p>Each monster has a tag
        that identifies the type of creature it is. Certain spells, magic items,
        class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways
        with creatures of a particular type.</p><p>The game includes the
        following creature types, which have no rules of their
        own:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Aberrations</strong> are utterly alien
        beings, such as aboleths and
        cloakers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Beasts</strong> are non-Humanoid
        natural creatures, like horses and wolves, as well as most giant
        animals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Celestials</strong> are magical
        creatures, such as angels and pegasi, with ties to the Upper
        Planes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constructs</strong> are magically created
        creatures such as homunculi and shield
        guardians.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dragons</strong> are scaly beings of
        ancient origin, such as red dragons and
        wyverns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elementals</strong> are beings from the
        Elemental Planes, such as efreet and water
        elementals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fey</strong> are creatures tied to
        the Feywild or the forces of nature, such as dryads and
        goblins.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures tied to
        terrifying Lower Planes, such as balors and hell
        hounds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Giants</strong> are towering beings with
        humanlike shapes, like fire giants and
        trolls.</p></li><li><p><strong>Humanoids</strong> are people defined by
        their roles and professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors. They
        include members of varied
        species.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monstrosities</strong> are unnatural
        creatures with strange origins, such as mimics and
        owlbears.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oozes</strong> are gelatinous
        creatures, including black puddings and gelatinous
        cubes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plants</strong> are sentient vegetation
        and fungal monsters, such as shambling mounds and
        treants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Undead</strong> are spirits and the
        reanimated dead, such as ghosts, vampires, and
        zombies.</p></li></ul><h3>Descriptive Tags</h3><p>A monster might have
        one or more tags in parentheses following its type. Such tags provide
        additional categorization and have no rules of their own, but certain
        game effects might refer to them. Lists of monster groups related by
        descriptive tags appear in appendix B.</p><h2>Alignment</h2><p>The
        alignment specified in a monster's stat block is a default suggestion of
        how to roleplay the monster, inspired by its traditional role in the
        game or real-world folklore. Change a monster's alignment to suit your
        storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment, in particular, is an
        invitation for you to consider whether an individual leans toward one of
        the other alignments.</p><p>Character Creation describes the nine
        alignments and unaligned creatures.</p><h2>Armor Class</h2><p>A
        monster's Armor Class (AC) includes its natural armor, Dexterity, gear,
        and other defenses. See the Playing the Game for information on Armor
        Class.</p><h2>Initiative</h2><p>The Initiative entry specifies the
        monster's Initiative modifier followed by the monster's Initiative score
        in parentheses. Use the modifier when you roll to determine a monster's
        Initiative. A monster's Initiative modifier is typically equal to its
        Dexterity modifier, but some monsters have additional modifiers, such as
        Proficiency Bonus, applied to that number.</p><p>If you don't want to
        roll a monster's Initiative, use the Initiative score as the monster's
        Initiative in combat. Initiative is further detailed in Playing the
        Game<em>.</em></p><h2>Hit Points</h2><p>A monster's Hit Points are
        presented as a number followed by parentheses, where the monster's Hit
        Point Dice are provided, along with any contribution from its
        Constitution. Either use the number for the monster's Hit Points or roll
        the die expression in parentheses to determine the monster's Hit Points
        randomly; don't use both.</p><table><caption>Hit Dice by
        Size</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Monster Size</p></th><th><p>Hit
        Die</p></th><th><p>Average HP per
        Die</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Tiny</p></td><td><p>d4</p></td><td><p>2½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Small</p></td><td><p>d6</p></td><td><p>3½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Medium</p></td><td><p>d8</p></td><td><p>4½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Large</p></td><td><p>d10</p></td><td><p>5½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Huge</p></td><td><p>d12</p></td><td><p>6½</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gargantuan</p></td><td><p>d20</p></td><td><p>10½</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>A
        monster's size typically determines the die used to calculate its Hit
        Points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.</p><p>A monster's
        Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it
        possesses, and the result is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a
        monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has
        2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).</p><p>For more on Hit Points, see
        Playing the Game<em>.</em></p><h2>Speed</h2><p>The Speed entry specifies
        a monster's Speed. Some monsters have one or more of the following
        speeds: Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these specials
        speeds appear in Rules Glossary.</p><h2>Ability Scores</h2><p>Every
        monster has six ability scores along with corresponding ability score
        modifiers and saving throw modifiers. For more information on ability
        scores and saving throws, see Playing the
        Game<em>.</em></p><h2>Skills</h2><p>The Skills entry specifies a
        monster's skill proficiencies, if any. For example, a monster that is
        very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception)
        and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's
        relevant ability modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers
        might apply.</p><h2>Resistances and Vulnerabilities</h2><p>These entries
        list a monster's Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. See Playing
        the Game for more information.</p><h2>Immunities</h2><p>This entry lists
        the monster's Immunities, if any. If the monster has damage and
        condition Immunities, the damage types are listed before the conditions.
        See Playing the Game for details.</p><h2>Gear</h2><p>Monsters have
        proficiency with their equipment. If a monster has equipment that can be
        given away or retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The
        monster's stat block might include special flourishes that happen when
        the monster uses an item, and the stat block might ignore the rules in
        Equipment for that item. When used by someone else, a retrievable item
        uses its Equipment rules, ignoring any special flourishes in the stat
        block.</p><p>The Gear entry doesn't necessarily list all of a monster's
        equipment. For example, a monster that wears clothes is assumed to be
        dressed appropriately, and those clothes aren't in this
        entry.</p><p>Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is considered to
        be supernatural or highly specialized, and it is unusable when the
        monster is defeated.</p><h3>Ammunition and Ranged Attacks</h3><p>A
        monster that requires ammunition to make ranged attacks carries the
        necessary ammunition.</p><h3>Equipping a Monster with Other
        Items</h3><p>You may equip monsters with additional gear however you
        like, using the equipment chapter of the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbEquipment0000]{Equipment}
        for inspiration. You decide how much of a monster's equipment is
        recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that
        equipment is still usable.</p><p>Beware of giving a monster
        combat-oriented magic items, since those might alter the monster's
        Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic item, the monster can
        have Attunement with magic items as noted in Equipment. A monster with a
        class tag after its creature type is considered a member of that class
        for Attunement purposes.</p><h2>Senses</h2><p>The Senses entry specifies
        a monster's Passive Perception score, as well as any special senses the
        monster possesses. Passive Perception and special senses are described
        in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbAppendixCRule]{Rules
        Glossary}<em>.</em></p><h2>Languages</h2><p>This entry lists languages
        that the monster can use to communicate. Sometimes a monster can
        understand a language but can't communicate with it, which is noted in
        its entry. “None” indicates that a creature doesn't comprehend any
        language.</p><h3>Telepathy</h3><p>Telepathy is a magical ability that
        allows a creature to communicate mentally with another creature within a
        specified range. See
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbAppendixCRule]{Rules
        Glossary} for more information.</p><h2>Challenge Rating</h2><p>Challenge
        Rating is defined in Rules Glossary, while guidance on using CR to plan
        potential combat encounters is in<em>
        </em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.dmgDmsToolbox000]{Gameplay
        Toolbox}.</p><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>The number of Experience
        Points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the
        Experience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is awarded for defeating
        the monster in combat or otherwise neutralizing it.</p><p>Unless a rule
        says otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or another magical ability
        is worth the XP noted in its stat block.</p><table><caption>Experience

        Bonus</h3><p>A monster's Proficiency Bonus (PB) is determined by its CR,
        as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table, and is
        reflected in saving throws, skills, and other statistics where the
        monster's exceptional aptitude is a
        factor.</p><table><caption>Proficiency Bonus by Challenge

        monster's traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or
        in certain situations.</p><aside class="notable right four"><h4>Running
        a Monster</h4><p>To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its
        Challenge Rating, follow these rules during
        combat:</p><p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> If the monster has a
        special ability that deals a lot of damage but has a limited number of
        uses, such as a recharging breath weapon or a spell it can cast only
        once per day, have it use that special ability as quickly and as often
        as possible.</p><p><strong>Multiattack.</strong> If the monster has
        Multiattack, have it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which it's
        not using one of its more powerful abilities.</p><p><strong>Bonus
        Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions.</strong> If the monster has Bonus
        Actions, Reactions, or Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it
        uses them as often as it can.</p></aside><h2>Actions</h2><p>A monster
        can take the actions in this section or take one of the actions
        available to all creatures, as described in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.content24.JournalEntry.phbPlayingTheGam]{Playing
        the Game}.</p><h3>Attack Notation</h3><p>The entry for a monster's
        attack identifies whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and
        then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what
        happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says
        otherwise. For details on different kinds of attacks, see Playing the
        Game and Spells.</p><p><em><strong>Hit.</strong></em> Any damage dealt
        or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target
        are described after the “<em>Hit:</em>”
        notation.</p><p><em><strong>Miss.</strong></em> If an attack has an
        effect that occurs on a miss, that information follows the
        “<em>Miss:</em>” notation.</p><p><em><strong>Hit or Miss.</strong></em>
        If an attack has an effect that occurs regardless of whether it hits or
        misses its target, that information follows the “<em>Hit or Miss:</em>”
        notation.</p><h3>Saving Throw Effect Notation</h3><p>If an effect forces
        a saving throw, the effect identifies the kind of save required and then
        provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures make the save,
        and an explanation of what happens on a failed or successful
        save.</p><p>“Half damage only” on a successful save means the target
        takes half as much damage (round down) as targets that fail the save,
        while also ignoring all other parts of the effect.</p><h3>Damage
        Notation</h3><p>A stat block usually provides both a number and a die
        expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might
        deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. You decide whether to use the number
        or the die expression in parentheses; don't use
        both.</p><h3>Multiattack</h3><p>Some creatures can make more than one
        attack when they take the Attack action. Such creatures have the
        Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section of their stat block. This
        entry details the attacks a creature can make, as well as any additional
        abilities it can use, as part of the Attack
        action.</p><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>If a monster can cast any spells, its
        stat block lists the spells and provides the monster's spellcasting
        ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving throw), and spell
        attack bonus (if any spells require an attack roll). Unless noted
        otherwise, a spell of level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest
        possible level and can't be cast at a higher level.</p><p>A monster's
        spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a green slaad
        can cast the <em>Invisibility</em> spell, but the spell has a “self
        only” restriction, which means the spell affects only the
        slaad.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Components.</strong></em> The
        Spellcasting trait notes whether the monster's spellcasting ignores the
        need for certain spell components. If any spell components are required,
        describe the monster's use of Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to
        signal to characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that requires
        Material components has them.</p><p><em><strong>Casting Times of 1+
        Minutes.</strong></em> If a spell has a casting time of 1 minute or more
        yet is listed in a spellcasting action, the monster doesn't cast the
        spell in just one action unless the action's description states
        otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action on each of its turns
        and maintain Concentration to cast the spell, as described in Rules
        Glossary.</p><h2>Bonus Action</h2><p>If a monster has Bonus Action
        options, they are listed in this section. See Playing the Game for
        details on Bonus Actions.</p><h2>Reactions</h2><p>If the monster has
        Reaction options, those are listed in this section along with their
        triggers. See Playing the Game for details on
        Reactions.</p><h2>Legendary Actions</h2><p>If the monster has Legendary
        Action options, those are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is
        an action that a monster can take immediately after another creature's
        turn. Only one of these actions can be taken at a time and only after
        another creature's turn ends. The monster can't take a Legendary Action
        if it has the Incapacitated condition or is otherwise unable to take
        actions.</p><p>The monster has a limited number of Legendary Action
        uses, and that number is specified in the stat block. The monster
        expends one use whenever it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all
        expended uses at the start of each of its turns.</p><h2>Limited
        Usage</h2><p>Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the number
        of times they can be used. Here are the most common ways that usage is
        limited:</p><ul><li><p><strong>X/Day.</strong> This notation means the
        stat block part can be used a certain number of times (represented by X)
        and that a monster must finish a Long Rest to regain expended uses. For
        example, a Reaction that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be
        taken once and that the monster must finish a Long Rest to take it
        again.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recharge X–Y.</strong> This notation means
        a monster can use the stat block part once. At the start of each of the
        monster's turns, roll 1d6. If the roll is within the number range given
        in the notation (represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use of
        that part, which also recharges when the monster finishes a Short or
        Long Rest. For example, “Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can
        take the action once. Then, at the start of each of the monster's turns,
