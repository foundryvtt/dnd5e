      <p>It's hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human
      character has these traits.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong></em> Your ability scores each increase by
      1.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Humans reach adulthood in their
      late teens and live less than a
      century.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Humans tend toward no
      particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among
      them.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Humans vary widely in height
      and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your
      position in that range, your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read,
      and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically
      learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure
      dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed
      from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish
      military phrases, and so on.</p>
