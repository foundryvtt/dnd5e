    value: >-
      <p><em>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part
      and parcel of dwarven nature.</em></p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by
      2.</p><p><strong>Age.</strong> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans,
      but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average,
      they live about 350 years.</p><p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Most dwarves
      are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society.
      They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a
      belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just
      order.</p><p><strong>Size.</strong> Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet
      tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
      Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy
      armor.</p><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to life underground,
      you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim
      light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as
      if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p><p><strong>Dwarven Resilience.</strong> You have advantage on
      saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison
      damage.</p><p><strong>Dwarven Combat Training.</strong> You have
      proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and
      warhammer.</p><p><strong>Tool Proficiency.</strong> You gain proficiency
      with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies,
      or mason's tools.</p><p><strong>Stonecunning.</strong> Whenever you make
      an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you
      are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your
      proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency
      bonus.</p><p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write
      Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural
      sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language
      a dwarf might speak.</p><h5>Hill Dwarf</h5><p>As a hill dwarf, you have
      keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable
      resilience.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom
      score increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Dwarven Toughness.</strong> Your hit
      point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a
      level.</p><section class="secret"
      id="secret-bkbaaEWqAGbU8ZgK"><p><strong>Foundry
      Note</strong></p><p>Dwarven Toughness should be configured by adding 1 to
      the "Per Level" bonus in HP configuration on your character sheet
      (accessible using the cog next to your character's hit
      points).</p></section>
