      <p>Your half‑elf character has some qualities in common with elves and
      some that are unique to half-­elves.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other
      ability scores of your choice increase by
      1.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Half-­elves mature at the same
      rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much
      longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180
      years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Half-­elves share the
      chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and
      creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for
      followers. They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes
      prove unreliable, or at least
      unpredictable.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Half-­elves are about
      the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Thanks to your elf
      blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in
      dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong></em> You
      have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put
      you to sleep.</p><p><em><strong>Skill Versatility.</strong></em> You gain
      proficiency in two skills of your
      choice.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read,
      and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.</p>
