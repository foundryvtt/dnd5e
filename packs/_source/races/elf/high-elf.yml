      <p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of
      thousands of years of elven refinement.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong></em> Your Dexterity score increases by
      2.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Although elves reach physical
      maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of
      adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An
      elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and
      can live to be 750 years old.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em>
      Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly
      toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others'
      freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than
      not.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Elves range from under 5 to
      over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Accustomed to twilit
      forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim
      conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
      bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern
      color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Keen
      Senses.</strong></em> You have proficiency in the Perception
      skill.</p><p><em><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong></em> You have advantage on
      saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to
      sleep.</p><p><em><strong>Trance.</strong></em> Elves don't need to sleep.
      Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
      (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you
      can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that
      have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this
      way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of
      sleep.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and
      write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
      intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs
      and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so
      they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p><h5>High
      Elf</h5><p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least
      the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of
      high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be
      superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common
      and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other
      races.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your
      Intelligence score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Elf Weapon
      Training.</strong></em> You have proficiency with the longsword,
      shortsword, shortbow, and
      longbow.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrip.</strong></em> You know one cantrip of
      your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting
      ability for it.</p><p><em><strong>Extra Language.</strong></em> You can
      speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>
