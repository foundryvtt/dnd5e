      <p>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining
      semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is
      "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams
      are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of
      practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a
      human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
