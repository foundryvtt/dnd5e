      <p>Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all
      other gnomes.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your
      Intelligence score increases by 2.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em>
      Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle
      down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500
      years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Gnomes are most often
      good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers,
      scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are
      minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are
      good‑hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than
      vicious.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Gnomes are between 3 and 4
      feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is
      Small.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      25 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Accustomed to life
      underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
      see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Gnome Cunning.</strong></em> You
      have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws
      against magic.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak,
      read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the
      Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs
      of knowledge about the natural world.</p><h5>Rock Gnome</h5><p>As a rock
      gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other
      gnomes.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your
      Constitution score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Artificer's
      Lore.</strong></em> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check
      related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you
      can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you
      normally apply.</p><p><em><strong>Tinker.</strong></em> You have
      proficiency with artisan's tools (tinker's tools). Using those tools, you
      can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny
      clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24
      hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device
      functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time,
      you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three
      such devices active at a time.</p><p>When you create a device, choose one
      of the following options:</p><p><em>Clockwork Toy.</em> This toy is a
      clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon,
      or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the
      ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as
      appropriate to the creature it represents.</p><p><em>Fire Starter.</em>
      The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a
      candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your
      action.</p><p><em>Music Box.</em> When opened, this music box plays a
      single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches
      the song's end or when it is closed.</p>
