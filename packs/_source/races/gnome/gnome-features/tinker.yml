      <p>You have proficiency with artisan's tools (tinker's tools). Using those
      tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a
      Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24
      hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device
      functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time,
      you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three
      such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose one of the
      following options:</p>

      <p><em>Clockwork Toy:</em> This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or
      person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on
      the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns
      in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it
      represents.</p>

      <p><em>Fire Starter:</em> The device produces a miniature flame, which you
      can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires
      your action.</p>

      <p><em>Music Box:</em> When opened, this music box plays a single song at
      a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or
      when it is closed.</p>
