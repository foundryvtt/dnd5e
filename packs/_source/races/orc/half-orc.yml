      <p>Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc
      ancestry.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your
      Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by
      1.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Half-­orcs mature a little faster
      than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster
      and rarely live longer than 75
      years.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Half-orcs inherit a
      tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined
      toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their
      lives among them are usually evil.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em>
      Half‑orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from
      5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is
      Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is
      30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Thanks to your orc
      blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in
      dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
      darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness,
      only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Menacing.</strong></em> You gain
      proficiency in the Intimidation skill.</p><p><em><strong>Relentless
      Endurance.</strong></em> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not
      killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this
      feature again until you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Savage
      Attacks.</strong></em> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon
      attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time
      and add it to the extra damage of the critical
      hit.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and
      write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard
      consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish
      script.</p>
