      <p>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic
      ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the
      exhalation.</p><p>When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the
      area of the exhalation must make a Constitution saving throw, the type of
      which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving
      throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A
      creature takes 2d6 cold damage on a failed save, and half as much damage
      on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th
      level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</p><p>After you use your breath weapon, you
      can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
