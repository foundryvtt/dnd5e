      <p>Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with
      other dragonborn.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em>
      Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by
      1.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Young dragonborn grow quickly.
      They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a
      10-­year-­old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They
      live to be around 80.</p><p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em>
      Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the
      other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good,
      but those who side with evil can be terrible
      villains.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Dragonborn are taller and
      heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost
      250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em>
      Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><table><caption>Draconic

      Ancestry.</strong></em> You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of
      dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage
      resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the
      table.</p><p><em><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong></em> You can use your
      action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the
      size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.</p><p>When you use your
      breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a
      saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry.
      The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your
      proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half
      as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th
      level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</p><p>After you use your
      breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long
      rest.</p><p><em><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong></em> You have
      resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic
      ancestry.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read,
      and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest
      languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds
      harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and
      sibilants.</p>
