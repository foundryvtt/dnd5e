      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] babbles incoherently while it can see
      any creature and isn't incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn
      <strong>within 20 feet</strong> of the mouther and can hear the gibbering
      must succeed on a <strong>DC 10 Wisdom saving throw</strong>. On a
      failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next
      turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn.</p><p>On a
      1 to 4, the [[lookup @name lowercase]] does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the
      creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move
      in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a
      melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or
      does nothing if it can't make such an attack.</p>
