      nonmagical ferrous metal object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the
      object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of

      creature can make a  <strong>DC 11 Dexterity</strong> saving throw to
      avoid the [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s touch.If the object touched is
      either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, its takes a
      permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to
      an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the
      object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in the Rust
      Metal trait.</p></section><p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] corrodes a
