      <section class="secret"><p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] magically
      animates one or two trees it can see <strong>within 60 feet</strong> of
      it. These trees have the same statistics as a [[lookup @name lowercase]],
      except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak,
      and they have only the Slam action option. </p><p>An animated tree acts as
      an ally of the [[lookup @name lowercase]]. The tree remains animate for 1
      day or until it dies; until the [[lookup @name lowercase]] dies or is more
      than 120 feet from the tree; or until the [[lookup @name lowercase]] takes
      a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes
      root if possible.</p></section><p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] magically
