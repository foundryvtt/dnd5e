      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] has five heads. While it has more than
      one head, the [[lookup @name lowercase]] has<strong> advantage </strong>on
      saving throws <strong>against being blinded, charmed, deafened,
      frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious</strong><strong>.
      </strong></p><p>Whenever the [[lookup @name lowercase]] takes 25 or more
      damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] dies.</p><p>At the end of its turn, it grows
      two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it
      has taken <em>fire damage</em> since its last turn. the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] regains <strong>10 hit points</strong> for each head regrown
      in this way.</p>
