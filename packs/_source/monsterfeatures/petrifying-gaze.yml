      <p>If a creature starts its turn within <strong>30 ft.</strong> of the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] and the two of them can see each other, the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] can force the creature to make a <strong>DC 12
      Constitution saving throw</strong> if the [[lookup @name lowercase]] isn't
      incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to
      stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its
      next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is
      petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other
      magic.</p><p>A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid
      the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] until the start of its next turn, when it can
      avert its eyes again. If it looks at the [[lookup @name lowercase]] in the
      meantime, it must immediately make the save<strong>. I</strong>f the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] sees its reflection within <strong>30
      ft.</strong> of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and
      targets itself with its gaze.</p>
