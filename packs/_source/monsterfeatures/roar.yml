      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] emits a magical roar. Each time it roars
      before finishing a long rest, the roar is louder and the effect is
      different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] and able to hear the roar must make a saving
      throw.</p><p>**First Roar.** Each creature that fails a <strong>DC 18
      Wisdom</strong> saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened
      creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>**Second Roar.** Each
      creature that fails a <strong>DC 18 Wisdom</strong> saving throw is
      deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed
      and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
      the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>**Third Roar.** Each creature
      makes a <strong>DC 18 Constitution</strong> saving throw. On a failed
      save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a
      successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked
      prone.</p>
