      <section class="secret"><p>One humanoid that the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a  <strong>DC 13
      Charisma</strong> saving throw or be possessed by the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]]; the [[lookup @name lowercase]] then disappears, and the
      target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of
      awareness. </p><p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] can't be targeted by any
      attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn [[lookup
      @details.type.config.label lowercase]], and it retains its alignment,
      Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and
      frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but
      doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or
      proficiencies.The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points,
      the [[lookup @name lowercase]] ends it as a bonus action, or the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]] is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel
      evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The
      target is immune to this [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s Possession for 24
      hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession
      ends.</p></section><p>One humanoid that the [[lookup @name lowercase]] can
