      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] targets one humanoid or beast that she
      can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]], it must succeed on a <strong>DC 14 Wisdom</strong> saving
      throw or be magically charmed.</p><p>The charmed creature regards the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected.
      Although the target isn't under the [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s control,
      it takes the [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s requests or actions in the most
      favorable way it can.Each time the [[lookup @name lowercase]] or its
      allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw,
      ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24
      hours or until the [[lookup @name lowercase]] dies, is on a different
      plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action.
      If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s Fey Charm for the next 24 hours. the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]] can have no more than one humanoid and up to three
      beasts charmed at a time.</p>
