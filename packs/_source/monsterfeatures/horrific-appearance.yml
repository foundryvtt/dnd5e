      <p>Any humanoid that starts its turn <strong>within 30 feet</strong> of
      the [[lookup @name lowercase]] and can see the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]]'s true form must make a <strong>DC 11 Wisdom saving
      throw</strong>. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for <strong>1
      minute</strong>. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
      of its turns, with<strong> disadvantage </strong>if the hag is within line
      of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>If a creature's
      saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
      immune to the [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s Horrific Appearance for the
      next 24 hours<strong>. </strong>Unless the target is surprised or the
      revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes
      and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next
      turn, a creature that averts its eyes has<strong> disadvantage </strong>on
      attack rolls against the [[lookup @name lowercase]].</p>
