      <section class="secret"><p>A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends
      out from the [[lookup @name lowercase]]. The spores spread around corners.
      Each creature in that area must succeed on a  <strong>DC 14
      Constitution</strong> saving throw or become poisoned. </p><p>While
      poisoned in this way, a target takes <strong>5 (1d10) <em>poison
      damage</em></strong> at the start of each of its turns. A target can
      repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
      on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also
      ends the effect on it.</p></section><p>A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic
