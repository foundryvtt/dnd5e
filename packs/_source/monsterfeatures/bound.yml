      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] is magically bound to an amulet. As long
      as the [[lookup @name lowercase]] and its amulet are on the same plane of
      existence, the amulet's wearer can telepathically call the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] to travel to it, and the [[lookup @name lowercase]] knows the
      distance and direction to the amulet.</p><p>If the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] is <strong>within 60 feet</strong> of the amulet's wearer,
      half of any damage the wearer takes (rounded up) is transferred to the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]].</p>
