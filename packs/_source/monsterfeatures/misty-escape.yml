      outside its resting place, the [[lookup @name lowercase]] transforms into
      a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling

      points</strong> in mist form, it can't revert to its [[lookup @name

      destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least <strong>1
      hit point</strong>. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with
      <strong>0 hit points</strong>, it regains <strong>1 hit
