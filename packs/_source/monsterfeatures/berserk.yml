      <p>Whenever the [[lookup @name lowercase]] starts its turn with <strong>60
      hit points</strong> or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]] attacks the nearest creature it can see.</p><p>If no
      creature is near enough to move to and attack, the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than
      itself. Once the [[lookup @name lowercase]] goes berserk, it continues to
      do so until it is destroyed or regains all its<strong> hit
      points</strong>.</p>
