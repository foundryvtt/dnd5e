      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] moves up to its speed. While doing so,
      it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]] enters a creature's space, the creature must make a
      <strong>DC 12 Dexterity</strong> saving throw.On a successful save, the
      creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]]. A creature that chooses not to be pushed
      suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.</p><p>On a failed save,
      the [[lookup @name lowercase]] enters the creature's space, and the
      creature takes <strong>10 (3d6) <em>acid damage</em></strong> and is
      engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes
      <strong>21 (6d6) <em>acid damage</em></strong> at the start of each of the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s turns. When the [[lookup @name lowercase]]
      moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try
      to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a
      success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5
      feet of the [[lookup @name lowercase]].</p>
