      <p>While on the Ethereal Plane, the [[lookup @name lowercase]] magically
      touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil
      and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic
      circle.</p><p>As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful
      visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no
      benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10).
      If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target
      dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul
      bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed
      by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</p>
