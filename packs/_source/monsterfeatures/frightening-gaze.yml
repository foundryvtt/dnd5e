      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] fixes its gaze on one creature it can
      see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a  <strong>DC 18
      Wisdom</strong> saving throw against this magic or become grappled for 1
      minute. The grappled target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
      of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's
      saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune
      to the [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s gaze for the next 24 hours.</p>
