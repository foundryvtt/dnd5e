      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] makes one bite attack against a
      <strong>Medium or smaller target it is grappling</strong>. If the attack
      hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed,
      the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks
      and other effects outside the [[lookup @name lowercase]], and it takes
      <strong>21 (6d6) <em>acid damage</em></strong> at the start of each of the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s turns. A [[lookup @name lowercase]] can have
      only one creature swallowed at a time.</p><p>If the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed
      creature, the [[lookup @name lowercase]] must succeed on a  <strong>DC 14
      Constitution</strong> saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
      the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 ft. of the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]]. If the [[lookup @name lowercase]] dies, a swallowed
      creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by
      using 15 ft. of movement, exiting prone.</p>
