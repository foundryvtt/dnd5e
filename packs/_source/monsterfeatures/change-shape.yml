      <p>The [[lookup @details.type.config.label lowercase]] magically
      <strong>polymorphs</strong> into a <strong>humanoid</strong> or
      <strong>beast</strong> that has a challenge rating no higher than its own,
      or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any
      equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form
      (the [[lookup @details.type.config.label lowercase]]'s choice).</p><p>In a
      new form, the [[lookup @details.type.config.label lowercase]]
      <strong>retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak,
      proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. </strong>Its
      statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new
      form, <strong>except any class features or legendary actions of that
      form.</strong></p>
