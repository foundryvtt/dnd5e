      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] is immune to any effect that would sense
      its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it
      refuses. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]]'s intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.</p>
