      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] magically reads the surface thoughts of
      one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3
      ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of
      lead blocks it.</p><p>While the target is in range, the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]]'s concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a
      spell). While reading the target's mind, the [[lookup @name lowercase]]
      has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation,
      and Persuasion) checks against the target.</p>
