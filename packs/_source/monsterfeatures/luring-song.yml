      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] sings a magical melody. Every humanoid
      and giant within 300 ft. of the [[lookup @name lowercase]] that can hear
      the song must succeed on a  <strong>DC 11 Wisdom</strong> saving throw or
      be charmed until the song ends. the [[lookup @name lowercase]] must take a
      bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop
      singing at any time. The song ends if the [[lookup @name lowercase]] is
      incapacitated.</p><p>While charmed by the [[lookup @name lowercase]], a
      target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the
      charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]], the target must move on its turn toward the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]] by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It
      doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging
      terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source
      other than the [[lookup @name lowercase]], the target can repeat the
      saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end
      of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends
      on it.</p><p>A target that successfully saves is immune to this [[lookup
      @name lowercase]]'s song for the next 24 hours.</p>
