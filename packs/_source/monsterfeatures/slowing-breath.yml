      <p>**Slowing Breath.** The [[lookup @details.type.config.label lowercase]]
      exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on
      a  <strong>DC 18 Constitution</strong> saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more
      than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an
      action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for
      1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
      its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.</p>
