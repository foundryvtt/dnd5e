    value: >-
      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] covers herself and anything she is
      wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like
      another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends
      if the [[lookup @name lowercase]] takes a bonus action to end it or if she
      dies.</p><p>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
      inspection. For example, the [[lookup @name lowercase]] could appear to
      have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh.
      Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion
      and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that
      the [[lookup @name lowercase]] is disguised.</p>
