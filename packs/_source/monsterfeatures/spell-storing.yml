  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A spellcaster who wears the [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s amulet can
      cause the [[lookup @name lowercase]] to store one spell of 4th level or
      lower. To do so, the wearer must cast the spell on the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]]. The spell has no effect but is stored within the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]]. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a
      situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]] casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the
      original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new
      spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.</p>
