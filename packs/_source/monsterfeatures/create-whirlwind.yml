      <p>A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms
      on a point the [[lookup @name lowercase]] can see within 120 feet of it.
      Any creature but the [[lookup @name lowercase]] that enters the whirlwind
      must make a <strong>Strength</strong> saving throw or be restrained by it.
      the [[lookup @name lowercase]] can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an
      action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. A creature
      can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind,
      including itself, by succeeding on a Strength check. If the check
      succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest
      space outside the whirlwind.</p>
