      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] targets one creature it can see within
      30 ft. of it. The target must succeed on a  <strong>DC 14 Wisdom</strong>
      saving throw or be magically charmed by the [[lookup @name lowercase]]
      until the [[lookup @name lowercase]] dies or until it is on a different
      plane of existence from the target.</p><p>The charmed target is under the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s control and can't take reactions, and the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] and the target can communicate telepathically
      with each other over any distance.Whenever the charmed target takes
      damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect
      ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the
      saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the [[lookup @name
      lowercase]].</p>
