      <p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] targets one or more creatures it can see
      within 10 ft. of it. Each target must make a <strong>DC 17 Wisdom</strong>
      saving throw against this magic.</p><p>On a failed save, a target can't
      use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack
      on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus
      action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target
      can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
      effect on itself on a success.</p>
