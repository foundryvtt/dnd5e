      <section class="secret"><p>the [[lookup @name lowercase]] magically emits
      scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] that can see the light must succeed on a 
      <strong>DC 15 Wisdom</strong> saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
      </p><p>A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
      throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
      the [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s Horror Nimbus for the next 24
      hours.</p></section><p>A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
