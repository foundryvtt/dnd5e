      <p>Even when the [[lookup @name lowercase]] is in plain sight, it takes a
      successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> to spot a
      [[lookup @name lowercase]] that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature
      that tries to enter the [[lookup @name lowercase]]'s space while unaware
      of the [[lookup @name lowercase]] is surprised by the [[lookup @name
