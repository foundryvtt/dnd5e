      <p>A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the [[lookup
      @name lowercase]]. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly
      obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses
      it.</p><p>Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on
      a  <strong>DC 11 Constitution</strong> saving throw or be poisoned until
      the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can
      take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't
      take reactions. 1 use per day.</p>
