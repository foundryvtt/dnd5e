        <h2>Racial Traits</h2><p>The description of each race includes racial
        traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries
        appear among the traits of most races.</p><h3>Ability Score
        Increase</h3><p>Every race increases one or more of a character’s
        ability scores.</p><h3>Age</h3><p>The age entry notes the age when a
        member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s
        expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your
        character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your
        character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability
        scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age
        could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while
        advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or
        Wisdom.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Most races have tendencies toward
        certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for
        player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for
        example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define
        your character.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Characters of most races are Medium,
        a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall.
        Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which
        means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most
        important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding
        heavy weapons, as explained in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.BYFd9hiJGo9L5aOM]{Chapter 5:
        Equipment}.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Your speed determines how far you can
        move when traveling
        (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.aYmUMcQfSIqYWpKk]{Chapter 8:
        Adventuring}) and fighting
        (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.6PfYpwxkdQkyS6b7]{Chapter 9:
        Combat}).</p><h3>Languages</h3><p>By virtue of your race, your character
        can speak, read, and write certain
        languages.</p><h3>Subraces</h3><p>Some races have subraces. Members of a
        subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits
        specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary
        significantly from race to race and world to
        world.</p><h2>Dwarf</h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.Item.UQiRQUTBcsz8gZU1]{Hill
