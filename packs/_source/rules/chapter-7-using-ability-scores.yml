        <p>Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s
        physical and mental characteristics:</p>

        <ul>

        <li><strong>Strength</strong>, measuring physical power</li>

        <li><strong>Dexterity</strong>, measuring agility</li>

        <li><strong>Constitution</strong>, measuring endurance</li>

        <li><strong>Intelligence</strong>, measuring reasoning and memory</li>

        <li><strong>Wisdom</strong>, measuring perception and insight</li>

        <li><strong> Charisma</strong>, measuring force of personality</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming?
        Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s
        assets as well as weaknesses.</p>

        <p>The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw,
        and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book’s
        introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20,
        add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
        compare the total to a target number.</p>

        <p>Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the
        magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of
        innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and
        competence in activities related to that ability.</p>

        <p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and
        many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18
        is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have
        scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as
        high as 30.</p>

        <p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging
        from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The
        Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the
        range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p>

        <p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability
        check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often
        than their associated scores.</p>

        <p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have
        advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an
        attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the
        roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the
        lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have
        disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have
        advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p>

        <p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or
        imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20.
        If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll
        only one additional d20.</p>

        <p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and
        disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll
        one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage
        and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you
        have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p>

        <p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game,
        such as the halfling’s
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.races.Item.LOMdcNAGWh5xpfm4]{Lucky} trait, lets
        you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose
        which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on
        an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the
        Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p>

        <p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special
        abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character
        advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in
        one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as
        a result.</p>

        <p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters
        also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The
        bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack
        rolls.</p>

        <p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other
        number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can
        add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless
        add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p>

        <p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided
        (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the
        rogue’s
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.3sYPftQKnbbVnHrh]{Expertise}
        feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a
        circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once
        to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it
        only once.</p>

        <p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your
        proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally
        benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to
        the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact
        that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack
        proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature
        that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence
        (History) checks.</p>

        <p>In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack
        rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so,
        these same rules apply.</p>

        <p>An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and
        training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an
        ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than
        an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,
        the dice determine the results.</p>

        <p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is
        relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented
        by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The
        Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p>

        <table border="0"><caption>

        <h4>Typical Difficulty Classes</h4>

        </caption>

        <thead>

        <tr>

        <tbody>

        <tr>

        <td>Very easy</td>

        <td>5</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>

        <td>Easy</td>

        <td>10</td>

        <td>15</td>

        </tr>

        <td>30</td>

        </tr>

        </tbody>

        </table>

        <p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability
        modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and
        compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the
        ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand.
        Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no
        progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback
        determined by the GM.</p>

        <h2>Contests</h2>

        <p>Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed
        to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same
        thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic
        ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one
        of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—
        for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an
        adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is
        determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p>

        <p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to
        their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but
        instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their
        two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the
        contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or
        prevents the other one from succeeding.</p>

        <p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it
        was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by
        default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the
        floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying
        to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie
        means that the door remains shut.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills
        that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a
        specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in
        a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting
        skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a
        monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)</p>

        <p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to
        pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each
        of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics,
        Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has
        proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity
        checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p>

        <p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following
        list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's
        description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to
        use a skill associated with an ability.</p>

        <h3>Strength</h3>

        <ul>

        <li>Athletics</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Dexterity</h3>

        <ul>

        <li>Acrobatics</li>

        <li>Sleight of Hand</li>

        <li>Stealth</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Intelligence</h3>

        <ul>

        <li>Arcana</li>

        <li>History</li>

        <li>Investigation</li>

        <li>Nature</li>

        <li>Religion Wisdom</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Wisdom</h3>

        <ul>

        <li>Animal Handling</li>

        <li>Insight</li>

        <li>Medicine</li>

        <li>Perception</li>

        <li>Survival</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Charisma</h3>

        <ul>

        <li>Deception</li>

        <li>Intimidation</li>

        <li>Performance</li>

        <li>Persuasion</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific
        skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a
        player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to
        a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can
        add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that
        skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal
        ability check.</p>

        <p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff,
        the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is
        proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to
        the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she
        just makes a Strength check.</p>

        <h3>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h3>

        <p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind
        of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies
        to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might
        reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM
        might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill,
        or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different
        check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the
        mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have
        the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you
        to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution
        (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your
        proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally
        do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc
        barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM
        might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation
        is normally associated with Charisma.</p>

        <h2>Passive Checks</h2>

        <p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't
        involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for
        a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over
        again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether
        the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as
        noticing a hidden monster.</p>

        <p>Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:</p>

        <p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p>

        <p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage,
        subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a
        <strong>score</strong>.</p>

        <p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and
        proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
        score of 14.</p>

        <p>The rules on hiding in the
        @UUID[.xt6tSGvU9e0vtXw6#dexterity]{Dexterity} section below rely on
        passive checks, as do the exploration rules.</p>

        <h2>Working Together</h2>

        <p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The
        character who's leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability
        modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help
        provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help
        action.</p>

        <p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she
        could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires
        proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that
        proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a
        character can help only when two or more individuals working together
        would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle,
        are no easier with help.</p>

        <h3>Group Checks</h3>

        <p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a
        group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation,
        the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who
        aren't.</p>

        <p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the
        ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group
        succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p>

        <p>Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when
        all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when
        adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom
        (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand,
        sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least
        half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide
        their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one
        of these hazards.</p>

        <p>A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a
        spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't
        normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one
        because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p>

        <p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability
        modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity
        saving throw.</p>

        <p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and
        can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the
        GM.</p>

        <p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The
        wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill
        proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or
        her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability
        score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p>

        <p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect
        that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a
        spell is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency
        bonus.</p>

        <p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in
        the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a
        creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect</p>
