        <p>Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for
        playing your character in a way that's true to his or her personality
        traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on
        your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an
        edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you
        call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the
        effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</p><h2
        data-anchor="gaining-inspiration">Gaining Inspiration</h2><p>Your GM can
        choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs
        award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the
        drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your
        character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn
        inspiration in the game.</p><p>You either have inspiration or you
        don't—you can't stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.</p><h2
        data-anchor="using-inspiration">Using Inspiration</h2><p>If you have
        inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving
        throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage
        on that roll.</p><p>Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can
        reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply
        doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does
        something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting
        way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character
        inspiration.</p>

        <p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is
        important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use
        a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at
        hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a
        scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep
        down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at
        the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond
        for anything interesting or valuable.</p><p>In a city or wilderness, a
        scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often more appropriate. Adventurers
        eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across
        those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.</p><p>For long
        journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best. Following the
        road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four
        uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their
        journey.</p><p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game
        relies on <strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time.</p>

        check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a
        successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>

        <p>The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When

        signs of your presence.</p><p>You can't hide from a creature that can

        noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p><p>In combat, most creatures
        stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding
        and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain

        <p><strong>Passive Perception.</strong> When you hide, there's a chance
        someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine
        whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity
        (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score,
        which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other
        bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For
        disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a
        proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and
        proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)

        adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2.

        <p><strong>Persuasion. </strong>When you attempt to influence someone or
        a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might
        ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use
        persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make
        cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading
        others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king,
        negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of
        townsfolk.</p>

        <p>A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the

        tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise,
        the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the
        passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side.
        Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at
        the start of the encounter.</p><p>If you're surprised, you can't move or
        take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a
        reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even
        if the other members aren't.</p>

        highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the
        order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round.
        The initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p><p>If a
        tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures,
        and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can
        decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character.
        Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a
        d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>

        <p>You can <strong>drop prone</strong> without using any of your speed.
        <strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount
        of movement equal to half your speed.</p><p>For example, if your speed
        is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t
        stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is

        <p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls
        in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical
        Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a
        space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5- foot-wide doorway,
        other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets
        them.</p><p>A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight
        effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures
        that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium
        combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another
        one.</p><p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them
        can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium
        or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as
        many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>

        <p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters,

        action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a
        spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a
        casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action
        in combat to cast such a spell.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular
        circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on
        your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of
        your next turn.</p><p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance
        will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in
        response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in
        response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor,
        I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me,
        I move away.”</p><p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your
        reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.
        Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p><p>When you
        ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you
        release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a
        spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s
        magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell
        dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating
        on the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.UJJu9c2UvCzVljiP]{Web} spell
        and ready @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{Magic
        Missile}, your Web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release
        Magic Missile with your reaction, your concentration might be
        broken.</p>

        size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one
        free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead
        of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the
        target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the
        target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the
        target to the grappled condition (see appendix PH-A). The condition
        specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target
        whenever you like (no action required).</p><p>@Embed[.2TZKy9YbMN3ZY3h8

        bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that

        <p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is

        or a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of

        points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so
        any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example,
        a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14
        current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains
        6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p><p>A creature that has died can’t

        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{Revivify} spell has

        <p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a
        special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether
        you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws,
        this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate
        now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of
        succeeding on a saving throw.</p><p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or
        higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no
        effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below).
        On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to
        be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.
        The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or
        become stable.</p><p>@Embed[.fwJOeFAJn8DkwebA

        <p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a
        creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a
        buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from
        injury.</p><p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the
        temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries
        over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit
        points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then
        take 2 damage.</p><p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your
        actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character
        can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit
        points.</p><p>Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t
        be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of
        them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new
        ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when
        you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p><p>If you have 0
        hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to
        consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at
        you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save
        you.</p><p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a
        duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long
        rest.</p>

        vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits
        from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew,
        ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.</p><p>Certain

        as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.TjWk2mpNXjDdfIDM]{Carpet of

        <p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general
        indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive)
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{Magic Missile} at
        1st level and the earth-shaking
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{Wish} at 9th.
        Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by
        rote—are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a
        spellcaster must be to use that spell.</p><p>Spell level and character
        level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at
        least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.</p>

        <p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell
        firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item.
        Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited
        list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing
        is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as
        clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process
        varies for different classes, as detailed in their
        descriptions.</p><p>In every case, the number of spells a caster can
        have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's
        level.</p>

        <p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she
        can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating
        the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell
        is physically and mentally taxing, and higherlevel spells are even more
        so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the
        warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell
        level a character can use at each character level. For example, the
        3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level
        slots.</p><p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of
        that spell's level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the
        spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small
        for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level
        spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a
        9th-level slot. So when Umara casts
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{Magic Missile}, a
        1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has
        three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell
        slots.</p><p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that
        let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who
        follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain
        eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast
        spells in such a way.</p><h3>Casting a Spell at a Higher

        <p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher
        level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that
        casting. For instance, if Umara casts

        </em>using one of her 2nd-level slots, that <em>magic missile </em>is
        2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put
        into.</p><p>Some spells, such as <em>magic missile </em>and
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds}, have

        concentration:</p><ul><li><strong>Casting another spell that requires
        concentration. </strong>You lose concentration on a spell if you cast
        another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two
        spells at once.</li><li><strong>Taking damage. </strong>Whenever you
        take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a
        Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals
        10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take
        damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath,
        you make a separate saving throw for each source of
        damage.</li><li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed. </strong>You lose
        concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you
        die.</li></ul><p>The GM might also decide that certain environmental
        phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a
        storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving
        throw to maintain concentration on a spell.</p>

        <p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine
        whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus
        with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your
        proficiency bonus.</p><p>Most spells that require attack rolls involve
        ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack
        roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and
        that isn’t incapacitated.</p>

        from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify

        <p>Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches
        something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers
        include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor,
        pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a
        lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area
        or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{Glyph of Warding}
        spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password
        that prevents the trap from activating.</p>

        <p>Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection.
        Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure
        plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in
        the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect
        something that points to a trap’s presence.</p><p>A trap’s description
        specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A
        character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception)
        check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the
        trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to
        determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If
        the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able
        to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You
        might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to
        deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using
        thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p><p>Any character
        can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic
        trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description.
        The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} has a
        chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description
        provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel
        magic</em>.</p><p>In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough
        that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the
        trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to
        override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing
        on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design
        can anticipate every possible action that the characters might
        attempt.</p><p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without
        making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s
        presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a
        pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is
        required.</p><p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider
        a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling
        on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of
        poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest
        and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s
        trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front
        of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this
        case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly
        into the shield.</p><p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that
        allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place
        traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without
        harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable
        their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes
        around the trap.</p>

        <p>The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making
        use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas,
        blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple
        elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate
        enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when
        it is triggered.</p><p>The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist
        its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s
        severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage
        Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap
        severity.</p><p>A trap intended to be a <strong>setback</strong> is

        <p>Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they
        execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process
        of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat
        encounter.</p><p>When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The
        trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap
        activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive
        attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or
        otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can
        be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.</p><p>For
        example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a
        complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several
        rounds, the room is completely flooded.</p>

        <p>Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable

        can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of
        the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects
        such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict
        madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who
        uses or becomes attuned to them.</p><p>Resisting a madness-inducing
        effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.</p>

        little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal
        statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one
        torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.x5JNBSyIBBZsjcGT]{Earthquake} spell
        can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan
        object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the
        object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If
        you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller
        sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one
        of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a
        Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large
        legs is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

        <p>Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before
        their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement,
        and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a
        class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item.
        (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has
        spell slots and uses that class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to
        be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell
        using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the
        like.</p><p>Without becoming attuned to an item that requires
        attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its
        description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires
        attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not
        attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.</p><p>Attuning to an
        item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item
        while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same short
        rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form
        of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or
        some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the
        attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the
        creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical
        properties of the item, including any necessary command words.</p><p>An
        item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can
        be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to
        attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to
        an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one
        copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.QtmVEreNIWEVOoLR]{Ring of Protection}
        at a time.</p><p>A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature
        no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has
        been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature
        dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also
        voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the
        item, unless the item is cursed.</p>

        <p>Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A
        magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion:
        boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head,
        and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped
        to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be
        held.</p><p>In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit
        a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to
        be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.
        Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item
        to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it
        doesn't adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only.
        Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped
        folk.</p><p>When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your
        discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed
        on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of
        legs can't wear boots.</p><h3>Multiple Items of the Same

        <p>Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item. The
        spell is cast at the lowest possible spell level, doesn't expend any of
        the user's spell slots, and requires no components, unless the item's
        description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time,
        range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the
        spell requires concentration. Many items, such as potions, bypass the
        casting of a spell and confer the spell's effects, with their usual
        duration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the
        casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.</p><p>A magic item,
        such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting
        ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one
        spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you
        don't have a spellcasting ability—perhaps you're a rogue with the Use
        Magic Device feature—your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the
        item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.</p>

        suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings.
        Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly
        evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears),
        orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>

        nature.</p><p>Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension
        of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices,

        <p>A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate
        Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of
        1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and
        can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its
        level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge
        rating.</p><p>An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions.
        For example, a drow mage can innately cast the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.MRxldJd6C4bsBo3O]{Levitate} spell,
        but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell
        affects only the drow mage.</p><p>A monster’s innate spells can’t be
        swapped out with other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t
        require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.</p>

        <p>A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level
        and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and
        higher (as explained in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>). The spellcaster
        level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.</p><p>The
        monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class.
        The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as
        the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.x637K2Icp2ZFM1TB]{Divine
        Domain} feature of the cleric or the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi]{Druid
        Circle} feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that
        class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in
        the class or access to its spell list.</p><p>A monster can cast a spell
        from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For
        example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ]{Lightning Bolt}
        spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level
        spell slots.</p><p>You can change the spells that a monster knows or has
        prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same
        level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the
        monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge
        rating.</p>

        <p>Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple
        prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make
        an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds,
        unless the attack says otherwise.</p><p>A creature grappled by the
        monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed
        on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the
        escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume
        the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength (Athletics) modifier.</p>

        <p>A legendary creature can take a certain number of special
        actions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary
        action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another
        creature’s turn. A creature regains its spent legendary actions at the
        start of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while
        incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it
        can’t use them until after its first turn in the combat.</p>

        <p>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a
        mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can
        read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material
        components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell
        by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the
        spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If
        the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p><p>If the spell
        is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can
        normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting
        ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10
        + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the
        scroll with no other effect.</p><p>The level of the spell on the scroll
        determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the
