        <p>Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for
        playing your character in a way that's true to his or her personality
        traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on
        your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an
        edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you
        call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the
        effect of a spell that has been laid on you.</p><h2
        data-anchor="gaining-inspiration">Gaining Inspiration</h2><p>Your GM can
        choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs
        award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the
        drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your
        character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn
        inspiration in the game.</p><p>You either have inspiration or you
        don't—you can't stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.</p><h2
        data-anchor="using-inspiration">Using Inspiration</h2><p>If you have
        inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving
        throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage
        on that roll.</p><p>Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can
        reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply
        doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does
        something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting
        way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character
        inspiration.</p>

        <p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is
        important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use
        a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at
        hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a
        scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep
        down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at
        the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond
        for anything interesting or valuable.</p><p>In a city or wilderness, a
        scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often more appropriate. Adventurers
        eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across
        those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.</p><p>For long
        journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best. Following the
        road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four
        uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their
        journey.</p><p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game
        relies on <strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time.</p>

        <p>While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot
        (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or

        or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)
        check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a
        successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p>

        and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain

        <p><strong>Passive Perception.</strong> When you hide, there's a chance
        someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine

        which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other
        bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For
        disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a
        proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and
        proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)

        adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2.

        Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a
        d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p>

        <p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls
        in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical
        Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a
        space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5- foot-wide doorway,
        other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets
        them.</p><p>A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight
        effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures
        that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium
        combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another
        one.</p><p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them
        can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium
        or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as
        many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular
        circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on
        your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of
        your next turn.</p><p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance
        will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in
        response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in
        response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor,
        I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me,
        I move away.”</p><p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your
        reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.
        Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p><p>When you
        ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you
        release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a
        spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s
        magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell
        dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating
        on the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.UJJu9c2UvCzVljiP]{Web} spell
        and ready @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{Magic
        Missile}, your Web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release
        Magic Missile with your reaction, your concentration might be
        broken.</p>

        <p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a
        foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon
        such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee
        attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other
        body part. A few spells also involve making a melee
        attack.</p><p>@Embed[.hgZ5ZN4B3y7tmFlt

        <p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an
        enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an
        opportunity attack.</p><p>You can make an opportunity attack when a
        hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the
        opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack
        against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the
        creature leaves your reach.</p><p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity
        attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an
        opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves
        you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you
        don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a
        foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</p>

        <p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the
        attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice
        twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal.
        To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p><p>For
        example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the
        damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If
        the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak
        Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p>

        <p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually
        easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p><p>If a creature or an
        object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a damage type, damage of that
        type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has
        <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is
        doubled against it.</p><p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied
        after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has
        resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25
        bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that
        reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then
        halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p><p>Multiple instances of
        resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as
        only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire
        damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a
        nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by
        threequarters.</p>

        <p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is
        reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit
        points, and magical methods such as a
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds} spell
        or a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of
        Healing} can remove damage in an instant.</p><p>When a creature receives
        healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit
        points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so
        any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example,
        a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14
        current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains
        6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p><p>A creature that has died can’t
        regain hit points until magic such as the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{Revivify} spell has

        On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to
        be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind.

        <p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a
        creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a
        buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from
        injury.</p><p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the
        temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries
        over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit
        points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then
        take 2 damage.</p><p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your
        actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character
        can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit
        points.</p><p>Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t
        be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of
        them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new
        ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when
        you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p><p>If you have 0
        hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to
        consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at
        you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save
        you.</p><p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a
        duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long
        rest.</p>

        <p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she
        can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating
        the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell
        is physically and mentally taxing, and higherlevel spells are even more
        so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the
        warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell
        level a character can use at each character level. For example, the
        3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level
        slots.</p><p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of
        that spell's level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the
        spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small
        for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level
        spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a
        9th-level slot. So when Umara casts
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{Magic Missile}, a
        1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has
        three remaining.</p><p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell
        slots.</p><p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that
        let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who
        follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain
        eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast
        spells in such a way.</p><h3>Casting a Spell at a Higher

        bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t

        <p><strong>Necromancy</strong> spells manipulate the energies of life
        and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain
        the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring
        the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy
        spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use
        such spells frequently.</p>

        <p>A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically
        has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.
        Every area of effect has a <strong>point of origin</strong>, a location
        from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify
        how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a
        point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature
        or an object.</p><p>A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the
        point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of
        origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t
        included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an
        obstruction must provide total cover.</p>

        <p>Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches
        something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers
        include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor,
        pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a
        lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area
        or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pB7XVYwdGNcUG935]{Glyph of Warding}
        spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password
        that prevents the trap from activating.</p>

        <p>Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection.
        Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure
        plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in
        the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect
        something that points to a trap’s presence.</p><p>A trap’s description
        specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A
        character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception)
        check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the
        trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to
        determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If
        the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able
        to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You
        might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to
        deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using
        thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.</p><p>Any character
        can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic
        trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description.
        The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition,
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} has a
        chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description
        provides the DC for the ability check made when you use <em>dispel
        magic</em>.</p><p>In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough
        that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the
        trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to
        override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing
        on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design
        can anticipate every possible action that the characters might
        attempt.</p><p>You should allow a character to discover a trap without
        making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s
        presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a
        pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is
        required.</p><p>Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider
        a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling
        on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of
        poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest
        and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s
        trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front
        of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this
        case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly
        into the shield.</p><p>Traps are often designed with mechanisms that
        allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place
        traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without
        harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable
        their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes
        around the trap.</p>

        <p>Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they
        execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process
        of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat
        encounter.</p><p>When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The
        trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap
        activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive
        attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or
        otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can
        be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.</p><p>For
        example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a
        complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several
        rounds, the room is completely flooded.</p>

        <p>Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before
        their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement,
        and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a
        class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item.
        (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if it has
        spell slots and uses that class's spell list.) If the prerequisite is to
        be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell
        using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the
        like.</p><p>Without becoming attuned to an item that requires
        attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its
        description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires
        attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not
        attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.</p><p>Attuning to an
        item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item
        while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same short
        rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form
        of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or
        some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the
        attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the
        creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical
        properties of the item, including any necessary command words.</p><p>An
        item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can
        be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to
        attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to
        an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one
        copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.QtmVEreNIWEVOoLR]{Ring of Protection}
        at a time.</p><p>A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature
        no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has
        been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature
        dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also
        voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the
        item, unless the item is cursed.</p>

        <p>Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A
        magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion:
        boots go on the feet, gloves on the hands, hats and helmets on the head,
        and rings on the finger. Magic armor must be donned, a shield strapped
        to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be
        held.</p><p>In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit
        a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to
        be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.
        Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item
        to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it
        doesn't adjust. For example, drow-made armor might fit elves only.
        Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf-sized and dwarf-shaped
        folk.</p><p>When a nonhumanoid tries to wear an item, use your
        discretion as to whether the item functions as intended. A ring placed
        on a tentacle might work, but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of
        legs can't wear boots.</p><h3>Multiple Items of the Same

        alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs,
        the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma
        check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the
        following demands:</p><ul><li>The item insists on being carried or worn
        at all times.</li><li>The item demands that its wielder dispose of
        anything the item finds repugnant.</li><li>The item demands that its
        wielder pursue the item's goals to the exclusion of all other
        goals.</li><li>The item demands to be given to someone
        else.</li></ul><p>If its wielder refuses to comply with the item's
        wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:</p><ul><li>Make it
        impossible for its wielder to attune to it.</li><li>Suppress one or more
        of its activated properties.</li><li>Attempt to take control of its
        wielder.</li></ul><p>If a sentient item attempts to take control of its
        wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal
        to 12 + the item's Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is
        charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try
        to follow the item's commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can
        repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the
        attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can't use this
        power again until the next dawn.</p>

        be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of
        an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into
        something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from
        a different monster or by using a <strong>variant</strong> or
        <strong>template</strong>, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind
        that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it,

        <p><strong>Fiends</strong> are creatures of wickedness that are native
        to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more
        labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests
        and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their
        bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost
        inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas,
        and yugoloths.</p>

        <p><strong>Giants</strong> tower over humans and their kind. They are
        humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or

        giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm
        giants. Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are
        giants.</p>

        <p><strong>Humanoids</strong> are the main peoples of a fantasy gaming
        world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous
        variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any
        innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting),
        and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most
        suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings.
        Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly
        evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears),
        orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>

        <p><strong>Monstrosities</strong> are monsters in the strictest
        sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural,
        and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation
        gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible
        curses (including minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and
        in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don’t fit
        into any other type.</p>

        <p>The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one
        or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and
        stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity
        (Stealth) checks.</p><p>A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant
        ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the
        monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by
        Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a
        monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its
        proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.</p>

        range. A telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic

        contact is terminated.</p><p>A creature within the area of an

        <p>A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level
        and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and
        higher (as explained in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>). The spellcaster
        level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.</p><p>The
        monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class.
        The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as
        the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.x637K2Icp2ZFM1TB]{Divine

        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi]{Druid
        Circle} feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that
        class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in
        the class or access to its spell list.</p><p>A monster can cast a spell
        from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For
        example, a drow mage with the 3rd-level
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.IyikgTEOTv701jgQ]{Lightning Bolt}
        spell can cast it as a 5th-level spell by using one of its 5th-level
        spell slots.</p><p>You can change the spells that a monster knows or has
        prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same
        level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the
        monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge
        rating.</p>

        <p>A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the
        psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special
        trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of
        the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically
        doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.</p>

        <p>The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee
        and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where

        other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are
        described after the “Hit” notation. You have the option of taking

        creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A
        battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone
        else, for instance.</p><p>If a spellcasting monster needs material
        components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material
        components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.</p>

        <p>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a
        mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can
        read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material
        components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell
        by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the
        spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If
        the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.</p><p>If the spell
        is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can
        normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting
        ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10
        + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the
        scroll with no other effect.</p><p>The level of the spell on the scroll
        determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the
        scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll
        table.</p><table><caption>Spell Scroll</caption><thead><tr><th

        wizard spell on a <em>spell scroll</em> can be copied just as spells in
        spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a <em>spell
        scroll</em>, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check
        with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the
        spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the
        <em>spell scroll</em> is destroyed.</p>
