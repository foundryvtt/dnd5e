        <p>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the
        relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most
        common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the
        copper piece (cp).</p><p>With one gold piece, a character can buy a
        bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not
        exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is
        the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not
        commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or
        services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions
        don’t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold
        piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold
        bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.</p><p>One gold piece is
        worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A
        silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil,
        or a night’s rest in a poor inn.</p><p>One silver piece is worth ten
        copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single
        copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.</p><p>In
        addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear
        in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp)
        originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes
        arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum
        piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten
        gold pieces.</p><p>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so
        fifty coins weigh a pound.</p><table><caption><h4>Standard Exchange

        <p>Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and
        more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures
        and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided
        that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.</p>

        <p><strong>Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.</strong> As a general rule,
        undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when
        sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good
        enough condition to sell.</p>

        <p><strong>Magic Items. </strong>Selling magic items is problematic.
        Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn't too hard, but other
        items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise,
        aside from a few common magic items, you won't normally come across
        magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond
        simple gold and should always be treated as such.</p>

        <p><strong>Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. </strong>These items retain
        their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in
        for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For
        exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a
        buyer in a large town or larger community first.</p>

        <p><strong>Trade Goods. </strong>On the borderlands, many people conduct
        transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars
        of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in
        the market and can be used as currency.</p>

      content: "<p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p><p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.</p><p><strong>Armor Proficiency. </strong>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.</p><p><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong> Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Heavy Armor. </strong>Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p><p><strong>Stealth. </strong>If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><p><strong>Shields. </strong>A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p><h2>Light Armor</h2><p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Padded. </strong>Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p><p><strong>Leather. </strong>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p><p><strong>Studded Leather. </strong>Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p><h2>Medium Armor</h2><p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Hide.</strong> This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</p><p><strong>Chain Shirt. </strong>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p><p><strong>Scale Mail. </strong>This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><strong>Breastplate. </strong>This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</p><p><strong>Half Plate. </strong>Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p><h2>Heavy Armor</h2><p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.</p><p>Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p><p><strong>Ring Mail.</strong> This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.</p><p><strong>Chain Mail. </strong>Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><strong>Splint. </strong>This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.</p><p><strong>Plate.</strong> Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Armor</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Armor</td><td>Cost</td><td>Armor Class (AC)</td><td>Strength</td><td>Stealth</td><td>Weight</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><em>Light Armor</em></td></tr><tr><td>Padded</td><td>5 gp</td><td>11 + Dex modifier</td><td>—</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>8 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Leather</td><td>10 gp</td><td>11 + Dex modifier</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>10 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Studded leather</td><td>45 gp</td><td>12 + Dex modifier</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>13 lb.</td></tr><tr><td><em>Medium Armor</em></td><td>\_</td><td>\_</td><td>\_</td><td>\_</td><td>\_</td></tr><tr><td>Hide</td><td>10 gp</td><td>12 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>12 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Chain shirt</td><td>50 gp</td><td>13 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>20 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Scale mail</td><td>50 gp</td><td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>45 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Breastplate</td><td>400 gp</td><td>14 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>20 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Half plate</td><td>750 gp</td><td>15 + Dex modifier (max 2)</td><td>—</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>40 lb.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><em>Heavy Armor</em></td></tr><tr><td>Ring mail</td><td>30 gp</td><td>14</td><td>—</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>40 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Chain mail</td><td>75 gp</td><td>16</td><td>Str 13</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>55 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Splint</td><td>200 gp</td><td>17</td><td>Str 15</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>60 lb.</td></tr><tr><td>Plate</td><td>1,500 gp</td><td>18</td><td>Str 15</td><td>Disadvantage</td><td>65 lb.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><em>Shield</em></td></tr><tr><td>Shield</td><td>10 gp</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>6 lb.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Getting Into and Out of Armor</h2><p>The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.</p><p><strong>Don. </strong>This is the time it takes to put on armor.

      content: "<p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.</p><p>The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A <strong>melee weapon</strong> is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a <strong>ranged weapon</strong> is used to attack a target at a distance.</p><h2>Weapon Proficiency</h2><p>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p><p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p><h2>Weapon Properties</h2><p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p><p><strong>Ammunition. </strong>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way</p><p><strong>Finesse. </strong>When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><strong>Heavy. </strong>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p><p><strong>Light. </strong>A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p><p><strong>Loading. </strong>Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><strong>Range.</strong> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><strong>Reach. </strong>This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.</p><p><strong>Special. </strong>A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).</p><p><strong>Thrown. </strong>If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p><p><strong>Two-Handed. </strong>This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><p><strong>Versatile. </strong>This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p><p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p><p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p><h3>Silvered Weapons</h3><p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p><h3>Special Weapons</h3><p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p><p><strong>Lance. </strong>You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.</p><p><strong>Net. </strong>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p><p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption>\_</caption><thead><tr><td>Name</td><td>Cost</td><td>Damage</td><td>Weight</td><td>Properties</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><em>Simple Melee Weapons</em></td></tr><tr><td>Club</td><td>1 sp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Dagger</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 piercing</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Greatclub</td><td>2 sp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>Two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Handaxe</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Javelin</td><td>5 sp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 30/120)</td></tr><tr><td>Light hammer</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Mace</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterstaff</td><td>2 sp</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td>Sickle</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1d4 slashing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Spear</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><em>Simple Ranged Weapons</em></td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, light</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>5 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 80/320), loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Dart</td><td>5 cp</td><td>1d4 piercing</td><td>1/4 lb.</td><td>Finesse, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Shortbow</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 80/320), two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Sling</td><td>1 sp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>—</td><td>Ammunition (range 30/120)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><em>Martial Melee Weapons</em></td></tr><tr><td>Battleaxe</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Flail</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Glaive</td><td>20 gp</td><td>1d10 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Greataxe</td><td>30 gp</td><td>1d12 slashing</td><td>7 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Greatsword</td><td>50 gp</td><td>2d6 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Halberd</td><td>20 gp</td><td>1d10 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Lance</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d12 piercing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Reach, special</td></tr><tr><td>Longsword</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Maul</td><td>10 gp</td><td>2d6 bludgeoning</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Morningstar</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Pike</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>18 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Rapier</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Finesse</td></tr><tr><td>Scimitar</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td>Shortsword</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td>Trident</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td>War pick</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Warhammer</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Whip</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Finesse, reach</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><em>Martial Ranged Weapons</em></td></tr><tr><td>Blowgun</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1 piercing</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 25/100), loading</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, hand</td><td>75 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 30/120), light, loading</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, heavy</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>18 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Longbow</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Net</td><td>1 gp</td><td>—</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Special, thrown (range 5/15)</td></tr></tbody></table>"

      content: "<p>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.</p><p><strong>Acid.</strong> As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p><p><strong>Alchemist's Fire. </strong>This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p><p><strong>Antitoxin. </strong>A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p><p><strong>Arcane Focus. </strong>An arcane focus is a special item— an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item— designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.</p><p><strong>Ball Bearings. </strong>As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p><p><strong>Block and Tackle. </strong>A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p><p><strong>Book. </strong>A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).</p><p><strong>Caltrops. </strong>As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p><p><strong>Candle. </strong>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p><p><strong>Case, Crossbow Bolt. </strong>This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p><p><strong>Case, Map or Scroll. </strong>This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p><p><strong>Chain. </strong>A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Climber's Kit. </strong>A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.</p><p><strong>Component Pouch. </strong>A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).</p><p><strong>Crowbar. </strong>Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.</p><p><strong>Druidic Focus. </strong>A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.</p><p><strong>Fishing Tackle. </strong>This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.</p><p><strong>Healer's Kit. </strong>This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p><strong>Holy Symbol. </strong>A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p><p><strong>Holy Water. </strong>As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p><p><strong>Hunting Trap.</strong> When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p><p><strong>Lamp. </strong>A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p><p><strong>Lantern, Bullseye. </strong>A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p><p><strong>Lantern, Hooded. </strong>A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p><p><strong>Lock. </strong>A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.</p><p><strong>Magnifying Glass.</strong> This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.</p><p><strong>Manacles. </strong>These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p><p><strong>Mess Kit. </strong>This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p><p><strong>Oil. </strong>Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p><p><strong>Poison, Basic.</strong> You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p><p><strong>Potion of Healing. </strong>A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.</p><p><strong>Pouch. </strong>A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).</p><p><strong>Quiver.</strong> A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.</p><p><strong>Ram, Portable. </strong>You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.</p><p><strong>Rations. </strong>Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p><p><strong>Rope.</strong> Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Scale, Merchant's. </strong>A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p><p><strong>Spellbook.</strong> Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p><p><strong>Spyglass.</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p><p><strong>Tent. </strong>A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.</p><p><strong>Tinderbox. </strong>This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.</p><p><strong>Torch.</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Adventuring

        <p>A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as
        craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race,
        class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools.
        Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any
        ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single
        ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of
        its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to
        carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a Strength check to
        make something out of particularly hard wood.</p><table

        These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade.
        The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each
        providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of
        artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability
        checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's
        tools requires a separate proficiency.</p><p><strong>Disguise
        Kit.</strong> This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets
        you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency
        with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks
        you make to create a visual disguise.</p><p><strong>Forgery Kit.
        </strong>This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments,
        pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other
        supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical documents.
        Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any
        ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a
        document.</p><p><strong>Gaming Set. </strong>This item encompasses a
        wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games
        such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools
        table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with
        a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you
        make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a
        separate proficiency.</p><p><strong>Herbalism Kit. </strong>This kit
        contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle,
        and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions.
        Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any
        ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency
        with this kit is required to create antitoxin and
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of
        Healing}.</p><p><strong>Musical Instrument.</strong> Several of the most
        common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples.
        If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add
        your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with
        the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting
        focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate
        proficiency.</p><p><strong>Navigator's Tools. </strong>This set of
        instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator's
        tools lets you chart a ship's course and follow navigation charts. In
        addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any
        ability check you make to avoid getting lost at
        sea.</p><p><strong>Poisoner's Kit.</strong> A poisoner's kit includes

        <p>A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness,
        but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow
        you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed
        and base carrying capacity.</p><p>An animal pulling a carriage, cart,
        chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base
        carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple
        animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity
        together.</p><p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in
        fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for
        purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs,
        and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for
        example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising
        the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or
        negotiating with the mount itself.</p><p><strong>Barding.</strong>
        Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and
        body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as
        barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids,
        and it weighs twice as much.</p><p><strong>Saddles.</strong> A military
        saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount
        in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain
        mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying
        mount.</p><p><strong>Vehicle Proficiency. </strong>If you have
        proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add
        your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of
        vehicle in difficult circumstances.</p><p><strong>Rowed Vessels.
        </strong>Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going
        downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to
        the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any
        significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on
        the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it
        over land.</p><table border="0"><caption><h4>Mounts and Other

        <p>Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain,
        land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or

        <p>Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are
        granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant
        ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set
        prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who
        may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly

        <p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for
        lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness,
        adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world,
        people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and
        clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more
        than others.</p><h2>Lifestyle Expenses</h2><p>Lifestyle expenses provide
        you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy
        world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your
        other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining
        your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p><p>At
        the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from
        the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The
        prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your
        chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by
        30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on
        the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same
        lifestyle throughout your character’s career.</p><p>Your lifestyle
        choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help
        you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of
        attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid
        criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful
        connections.</p><table><caption><h4>Lifestyle

        minimum</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Wretched.</strong> You live
        in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever
        you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the
        good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents
        abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you
        go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring
        gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the
        notice of most people.</p><p><strong>Squalid. </strong>You live in a
        leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested
        boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the
        elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in
        places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the
        notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people
        at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might
        be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from
        disease.</p><p><strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going
        without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and
        lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a
        sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations
        might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You
        benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with
        violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be
        unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and
        other disreputable types.</p><p><strong>Modest. </strong>A modest
        lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain
        your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a
        boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your
        living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest
        lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests,
        hedge wizards, and the like.</p><p><strong>Comfortable.
        </strong>Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford
        nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a
        small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a
        fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and
        military officers.</p><p><strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy
        lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have
        achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or
        royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful
        merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small
        businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a
        good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have
        a small staff of servants.</p><p><strong>Aristocratic. </strong>You live
        a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most
        powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a
        townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You
        dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable
        tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive
        invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend
        evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and
        nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and
        treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be
        drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p><div

        class="round" /></figure><article><h4>Self-Sufficiency</h4><p>The
        expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your
        time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services
        you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to
        sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters,
        though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization,
        sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing
        their own gear.</p><p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require
        you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time
        between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the
        equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets
        you live at the equivalent of a comfortable
        lifestyle.</p></article></div><h2>Food, Drink, and Lodging</h2><p>The

        nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety
        of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while
        others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with
        specialized adventuring skills.</p><p>Some of the most basic types of
        hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include
        any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city,
        when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a
        wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its
        miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might
        commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a
        tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front
        of the duke.</p><p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous
        services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a
        hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or
        esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of
        some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to
        run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep
        the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that
        includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered
        compensation.</p><table
        border="0"><caption><h4>Services</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Service</td><td>Pay</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td

        cp</td></tr><tr><td>Ship’s passage</td><td>1 sp per

        to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,
        tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown
        is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained
        hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill
        and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar
        workers.</p><h2>Spellcasting Services</h2><p>People who are able to cast
        spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be
        possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or
        favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a
        rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to
        find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p><p>Hiring someone
        to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds} or
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{Identify}, is easy
        enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the
        cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and
        willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large
        city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the
        spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of
        service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare
        item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness
        to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p>
