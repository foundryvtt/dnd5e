        <p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor,
        scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key
        role in fantasy gaming adventures.</p><p>The GM can summarize the
        adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel
        times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late
        in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a
        large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between
        encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient
        dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles
        of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone
        arch.”</p><p>Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes
        to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours,
        or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors:
        the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain
        they’re moving
        over.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.NizgRXLNUqtdlC1s.JournalEntryPage.HhqeIiSj8sE1v1qZ

        monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><h3>Travel

        dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply
        walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get
        where they need to go.</p><h3>Climbing, Swimming, and

        <p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are
        dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this
        section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers
        interact with the environment in such
        places.</p><h2>Falling</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.NizgRXLNUqtdlC1s.JournalEntryPage.kREHL5pgNUOhay9f

        Water</h2><p>@Embed[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.NizgRXLNUqtdlC1s.JournalEntryPage.RpvmpJcaWKJjfsfn
        inline]</p><h2>Interacting with Objects</h2><p>A character's interaction
        with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game.
        The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something,
        such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything,
        happens.</p><p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever,
        which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with
        water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in
        position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a
        situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the
        character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any
        such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p><p>Characters can
        also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to
        poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by
        physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines
        an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain
        objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's
        hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail
        Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects
        that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it
        breaks.</p><p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an
        object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p>

        <p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils,
        adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next
        adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks,
        such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their
        hard-earned gold.</p>

        <p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with
        little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM
        might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow
        you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At
        other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is
        passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p>

        <h2>Lifestyle Expenses</h2>

        <p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay
        the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p>

        <p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your
        character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and
        groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic
        lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the
        city than if you live in poverty.</p>

        <h2>Downtime Activities</h2>

        <p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing
        during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration,
        but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete
        before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be
        spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not
        need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days
        to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time,
        or switch to a new downtime activity.</p>

        <p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible.
        If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an
        activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p>

        <h3>Crafting</h3>

        <p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and
        works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object
        you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also
        need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it.
        For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in
        order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p>

        <p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or
        more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must
        expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you
        want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress
        every day in 5- gp increments until you reach the market value of the
        item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes
        300 days to craft by yourself.</p>

        <p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of
        a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with
        the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each
        character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping
        to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool
        proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in
        100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p>

        <p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to
        pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal
        cost.</p>

        <h3>Practicing a Profession</h3>

        <p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest
        lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long
        you continue to practice your profession.</p>

        <p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful
        employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to
        support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p>

        <p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your
        performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to
        support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p>

        <h3>Recuperating</h3>

        <p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a
        debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p>

        <p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15
        Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of
        the following results:</p>

        <ul>

        <li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit
        points.</li>

        <li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one
        disease or poison currently affecting you.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Researching</h3>

        <p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research,
        gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the
        campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling
        scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and
        gossip from their lips.</p>

        <p>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the
        information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find
        it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as
        needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM
        might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an
        Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the
        information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure
        someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information
        if it is available.</p>

        <p>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses.
        This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.</p>

        <h3>Training</h3>

        <p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or
        training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training
        options.</p>

        <p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM
        determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are
        required.</p>

        <p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you
        spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language
        or gain proficiency with the new tool.</p>
