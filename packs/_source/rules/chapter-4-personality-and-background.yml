        <p>A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly
        describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination
        of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and
        the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic,
        or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible
        combinations.</p>

        <p>These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical
        behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary
        significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly
        and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.</p>

        <p><strong>Lawful good</strong> (LG) creatures can be counted on to do
        the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most
        dwarves are lawful good.</p>

        <p><strong>Neutral good</strong> (NG) folk do the best they can to help
        others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and
        most gnomes are neutral good.</p>

        <p><strong>Chaotic good </strong>(CG) creatures act as their conscience
        directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many
        elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.</p>

        <p><strong>Lawful neutral </strong>(LN) individuals act in accordance
        with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are
        lawful neutral.</p>

        <p><strong>Neutral</strong> (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to
        steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems
        best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are
        neutral.</p>

        <p><strong>Chaotic neutral </strong>(CN) creatures follow their whims,
        holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and
        rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.</p>

        <p><strong>Lawful evil </strong>(LE) creatures methodically take what
        they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order.
        Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.</p>

        <p><strong>Neutral evil </strong>(NE) is the alignment of those who do
        whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many
        drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.</p>

        <p><strong>Chaotic evil </strong>(CE) creatures act with arbitrary
        violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red
        dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.</p>

        <h3>Alignment in the Multiverse</h3>

        <p>For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans,
        dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow
        the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the
        goodaligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose
        their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.</p>

        <p>The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to
        serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the
        nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the
        orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a
        good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its
        entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god's
        influence.)</p>

        <p>Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and
        fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend
        toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it
        somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.</p>

        <p>Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not
        have alignments—they are <strong>unaligned</strong>. Such a creature is
        incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its
        bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are
        not evil; they have no alignment.</p>

        <p>Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by
        default, and your background might give you access to one or more
        additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your
        character sheet.</p>

        <p>Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose
        one that is common in your campaign. With your GM's permission, you can
        instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret
        language, such as thieves' cant or the tongue of druids.</p>

        <p>Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many
        dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran,
        Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental
        planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can
        communicate with one another.</p>

        <p>Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals
        where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the
        world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled
        soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue
        might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a
        jester.</p>

        <p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about
        your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your
        background is <em>what changed</em>? Why did you stop doing whatever
        your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the
        money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy
        background, why don’t you have <em>more</em> money? How did you learn
        the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who
        share your background?</p>

        <p>The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits
        (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying
        suggestions.</p>

        <h3>Proficiencies</h3>

        <p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills
        (described in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Chapter 7:
        Using Ability Scores}).</p>

        <p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one
        or more tools (detailed in
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.BYFd9hiJGo9L5aOM]{Chapter 5:
        Equipment}).</p>

        <p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different
        sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind
        (skill or tool) instead.</p>

        <h3>Languages</h3>

        <p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages
        beyond those given by race. See @UUID[.jcpZgjk77lUW7OkM]{Languages}.</p>

        <h3>Equipment</h3>

        <p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use
        the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting
        equipment from your background.</p>

        <h3>Suggested Characteristics</h3>

        <p>A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on
        your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine
        them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics
        of your own creation.</p>

        <h3>Customizing a Background</h3>

        <p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it
        better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a
        background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any
        two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages
        from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package
        from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment
        section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package
        suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one
        ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches
        your desired background, work with your GM to create one.</p>
