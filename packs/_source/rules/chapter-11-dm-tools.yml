        <p>Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb
        might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor
        and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance
        might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among
        the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy
        game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or
        fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.</p><p>A trap can be either
        mechanical or magical in nature. <strong>Mechanical traps
        </strong>include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms,
        whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to
        operate. <strong>Magic traps</strong> are either magical device traps or
        spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated.
        Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function
        as traps.</p><h2>Traps in

        inline]</p><h2>Sample Traps</h2><p>The magical and mechanical traps
        presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical
        order.</p><h3>Collapsing Roof</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>This
        trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable
        section of a ceiling in place.</p><p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the
        ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip
        wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools
        disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools
        can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged
        tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.</p><p>Anyone who inspects
        the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As
        an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to
        trigger.</p><p>The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and
        anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of
        collapse.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling
        collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must
        succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
        Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble
        and becomes difficult terrain.</p><h3>Falling Net</h3><p><em>Mechanical
        trap</em></p><p>This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended
        from the ceiling.</p><p>The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and
        stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or
        foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15
        Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A
        character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with
        disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check,
        the trap triggers.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the net is
        released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped
        under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength
        saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to
        make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within
        its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5
        slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of
        it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.</p><h3>Fire-Breathing
        Statue</h3><p><em>Magic trap</em></p><p>This trap is activated when an
        intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of
        flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a
        dragon or a wizard casting a spell.</p><p>The DC is 15 to spot the
        pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A
        spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as
        detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the
        statue.</p><p>The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is
        placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot
        cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity
        saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as
        much damage on a successful one.</p><p>Wedging an iron spike or other
        object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A
        successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the
        trap.</p><h3>Pits</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>Four basic pit
        traps are presented here.</p><p><strong>Simple Pit.</strong> A simple
        pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large
        cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and
        debris.</p><p>The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth
        falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based
        on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are
        deeper).</p><p><strong>Hidden Pit. </strong>This pit has a cover
        constructed from material identical to the floor around it.</p><p>A
        successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot
        traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A
        successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to
        confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a
        pit.</p><p>When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a
        trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is
        usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.</p><p>Once the pit trap is
        detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the
        pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the
        cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also
        be magically held shut using the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.8cse7rit0oswRPUP]{Arcane Lock} spell
        or similar magic.</p><p><strong>Locking Pit. </strong>This pit trap is
        identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door
        that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the
        pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.</p><p>A successful
        DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can
        also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable
        the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using
        thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the
        character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a
        secret door nearby) opens the pit.</p><p><strong>Spiked Pit.</strong>
        This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened
        wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit
        takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any
        falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes.
        In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also
        make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one.</p><h3>Poison Darts</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>When a
        creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot
        from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the
        surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each
        one rigged to its own set of darts.</p><p>The tiny holes in the walls
        are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs,
        murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15.
        With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character
        can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the
        mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor.
        Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents
        the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents
        the darts contained within from launching.</p><p>The trap activates when
        more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing
        four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a
        random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant
        to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts
        don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage
        and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10)
        poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one.</p><h3>Poison Needle</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>A
        poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in
        something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the
        proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of
        poison.</p><p>When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches
        straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing
        damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15
        Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.</p><p>A successful
        DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce
        the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the
        needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms
        the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting
        to pick the lock triggers the trap.</p><h3>Rolling
        Sphere</h3><p><em>Mechanical trap</em></p><p>When 20 or more pounds of
        pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in
        the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid
        stone.</p><p>With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a
        character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the
        floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
        check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the
        pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the
        ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor.
        Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents
        the trap from activating.</p><p>Activation of the sphere requires all
        creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a
        +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere
        can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its
        space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a
        creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that
        creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55
        (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</p><p>The sphere stops
        when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but
        smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby
        passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.</p><p>As an action, a
        creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a
        DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is
        reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving
        and is no longer a threat.</p><h3>Sphere of
        Annihilation</h3><p><em>Magic trap</em></p><p>Magical, impenetrable
        darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The
        mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from
        it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters
        it is instantly obliterated.</p><p>A successful DC 20 Intelligence
        (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.2YNqk5zm9jDTvd7q]{Sphere of
        Annihilation} that can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise
        identical to a normal <em>sphere of annihilation</em>.</p><p>Some
        versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face,
        such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it
        and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the
        <em>sympathy </em>aspect of the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.GJ2WYm3SQFR0winH]{Antipathy/Sympathy}
        spell. A successful
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic} (DC
        18) removes this enchantment.</p>

        inline]</p><h2>Sample Diseases</h2><p>The diseases here illustrate the
        variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the
        saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics
        of these diseases to suit your campaign.</p><h3>Cackle Fever</h3><p>This
        disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While
        in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad
        laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname:
        “the shrieks.”</p><p>Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and
        include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level
        of exhaustion that can't be removed until the disease is
        cured.</p><p>Any event that causes the infected creature great
        stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or
        having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution
        saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic
        damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The
        creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
        ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a
        success.</p><p>Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet
        of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a
        DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the
        disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad
        laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.</p><p>At the
        end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13
        Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save
        and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When
        the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.
        A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly
        determined form of indefinite madness, as described later.</p><h3>Sewer
        Plague</h3><p>Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of
        illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps,
        and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those
        areas, such as rats and otyughs.</p><p>When a humanoid creature is
        bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into
        contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature
        must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become
        infected.</p><p>It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to
        manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps.
        The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains
        only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no
        hit points from finishing a long rest.</p><p>At the end of each long
        rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw.
        On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a
        successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one
        level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's
        level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the
        disease.</p><h3>Sight Rot</h3><p>This painful infection causes bleeding
        from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.</p><p>A beast or
        humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15
        Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection,
        the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1
        penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the
        end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by
        1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored
        by magic such as
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}
        or
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1]{Heal}.</p><p>Sight
        rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in
        some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an
        herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to
        the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from
        worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the
        disease entirely.</p>

        <p>In a typical campaign, characters aren’t driven mad by the horrors
        they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the
        stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign
        has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to
        reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of
        the threats the adventurers face.</p><h2>Going

        <p>When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash
        a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough
        time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible
        object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at
        damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall
        with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall
        does.</p><p>For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete,
        inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone,
        not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other
        objects.</p><h3>Statistics for

        poison has its own debilitating effects.</p><p><strong>Assassin's Blood
        (Ingested). </strong>A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC
        10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (1d12) poison
        damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature
        takes half damage and isn't poisoned.</p><p><strong>Burnt Othur Fumes
        (Inhaled). </strong>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on
        a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and
        must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each
        successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After
        three successful saves, the poison ends.</p><p><strong>Crawler Mucus
        (Contact).</strong> This poison must be harvested from a dead or
        incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed
        on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The
        poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw
        at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
        success.</p><p><strong>Drow Poison (Injury). </strong>This poison is
        typically made only by the drow, and only in a place far removed from
        sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13
        Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw
        fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in
        this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another
        creature takes an action to shake it awake.</p><p><strong>Essence of
        Ether (Inhaled). </strong>A creature subjected to this poison must
        succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8
        hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it
        takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it
        awake.</p><p><strong>Malice (Inhaled). </strong>A creature subjected to
        this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become
        poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is
        blinded.</p><p><strong>Midnight Tears (Ingested). </strong>A creature
        that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight.
        If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must
        succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one.</p><p><strong>Oil of Taggit (Contact). </strong>A creature
        subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
        throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is
        unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes
        damage.</p><p><strong>Pale Tincture (Ingested). </strong>A creature
        subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving
        throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned
        creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6)
        poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the
        poison deals can't be healed by any means. After seven successful saving
        throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal
        normally.</p><p><strong>Purple Worm Poison (Injury). </strong>This
        poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. A
        creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving
        throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Serpent Venom (Injury).
        </strong>This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated
        giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed
        on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a
        failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one.</p><p><strong>Torpor (Ingested).</strong> A creature subjected to
        this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become
        poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is
        incapacitated.</p><p><strong>Truth Serum (Ingested). </strong>A creature
        subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
        throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can't
        knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of a zone of truth
        spell.</p><p><strong>Wyvern Poison (Injury). </strong>This poison must
        be harvested from a dead or incapacitated wyvern. A creature subjected
        to this poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24
        (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
        successful one.</p>

        sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by
        the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used
        to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete
        with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient
        item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in
        the side.</p><p>Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items
        can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls
        are never sentient.</p><p>Sentient magic items function as NPCs under
        the GM's control. Any activated property of the item is under the item's
        control, not its wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good
        relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties
        normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its
        activated properties or even turn them against the
        wielder.</p><h3>Creating Sentient Magic
