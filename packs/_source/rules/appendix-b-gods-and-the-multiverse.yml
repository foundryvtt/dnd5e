        <p>The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy
        interpretations of historical religions from our world's ancient times.
        They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game,
        divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into
        pantheons that serve the needs of the game.</p>

        <h3>The Celtic Pantheon</h3>

        <p>It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a
        space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the
        whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on
        an oak—and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang
        from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the
        oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first
        forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the
        voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.</p>

        <p>The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they
        are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.</p>

        <h3>The Greek Pantheon</h3>

        <p>The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of
        waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the
        cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere,
        olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of
        nature echoes with their presence, and they've made a place for
        themselves inside the human heart, too.</p>

        <h3>The Egyptian Pantheon</h3>

        <p>These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to
        the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle
        of Ma'at—the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that
        puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical
        and rightful place in the universe.</p>

        <p>The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for
        death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god
        of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic
        evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris.
        And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.</p>

        <h3>The Norse Pantheon</h3>

        <p>Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords
        below, where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers
        flow forward and retreat with every fall and spring—this is the land of
        the Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It's a brutal clime, and
        one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to
        adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been
        too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of
        raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as
        well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for
        strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in
        every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the
        booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning
        longhouse.</p>

        <p>The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of
        war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once
        enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common
        enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).</p>

        the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and
        allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater
        power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or
        test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with
        each dawn.</p>

        <h2>The Material Plane</h2>

        <p>The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental
        forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of
        mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within
        the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and
        adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the
        Material Plane.</p>

        <p>The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they
        reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there,
        as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include
        magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where
        magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless
        Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have
        abandoned.</p>

        <h2>Beyond the Material</h2>

        <p>Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms
        of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different
        qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental
        principles abstracted from the ordinary world.</p>

        <h3>Planar Travel</h3>

        <p>When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are
        undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a
        mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a
        journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking
        out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in
        its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to
        come.</p>

        <p>Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in
        two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.</p>

        <p><strong>Spells. </strong>A number of spells allow direct or indirect
        access to other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can transport
        adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different
        degrees of precision.
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.PQuEgKyCdovOvhqN]{Etherealness}
        allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to
        any of the planes it touches—such as the Elemental Planes. And the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.TIoadMIsUKD4edXi]{Astral Projection}
        spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and
        travel to the Outer Planes.</p>

        <p><strong>Portals. </strong>A portal is a general term for a stationary
        interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a
        specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear
        window, or a fogshrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects
        the interplanar travel. Others are locations— circles of standing
        stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns—that exist in
        multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn.
        Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very
        similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano
        (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane
        of Water).</p>

        <h3>Transitive Planes</h3>

        <p>The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive
        Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways
        to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as
        <em>etherealness</em> and <em>astral projection</em> allow characters to
        enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Ethereal Plane </strong>is a misty, fog-bound dimension
        that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the
        Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so
        that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the
        Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and
        the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.DQzlB5Y3k791W5bH]{See
        Invisibility} and
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XzkJpE6XpZfKjODD]{True Seeing} spell
        grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material
        Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force
        energy such as
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Y7uWUO4yqUN0JKl0]{Forcecage} and
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.o9ZCvuD2B1OTcubb]{Wall of Force}. The
        depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists
        and colorful fogs.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Astral Plane</strong> is the realm of thought and dream,
        where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the
        divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and
        below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of
        light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in
        midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found
        here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</p>

        <h3>Inner Planes</h3>

        <p>The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its
        echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds
        were made. The four <strong>Elemental Planes</strong>—Air, Earth, Fire,
        and Water—form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the
        churning <strong>Elemental Chaos</strong>.</p>

        <p>At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material
        Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four
        Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four
        elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land,
        sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental
        Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their
        purest form—great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear
        water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when
        discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just
        the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure
        elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing
        energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.</p>

        <h3>Outer Planes</h3>

        <p>If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the
        multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for
        such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as
        divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes
        are best known as the homes of deities.</p>

        <p>When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must
        be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally “places” at
        all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought
        and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the
        perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while
        extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.</p>

        <p>Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive.
        Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to
        natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims
        of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the
        mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely,
        effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill
        their own needs.</p>

        <p>Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The
        perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can
        also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to
        take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth,
        in a single day—if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take
        weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.</p>

        <p>The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that
        correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades
        of distinction between them.</p>

        <h4>Outer Planes</h4>

        <p>The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the
        Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the
        <strong>Upper Planes</strong>. Planes with some element of evil are the
        <strong>Lower Planes</strong>. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in
        the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character
        whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense
        of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a
        neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil
        creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.</p>

        <h4>Demiplanes</h4>

        <p>Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique
        rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else.
        Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by
        spells, such as <em>demiplane</em>, or generated at the desire of a
        powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of
        existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the
        multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane
        can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane.
        Theoretically, a
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.J6Jpw5XzB5aTeqnz]{Plane Shift} spell
        can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency
        required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XbwGq5kDJNvAxNXV]{Gate} spell is more
        reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.</p>
