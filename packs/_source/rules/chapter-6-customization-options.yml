        <p>Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so
        lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character
        concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class
        options.</p>

        <p>With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class
        whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your
        current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to
        determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in
        wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.</p>

        <p>As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your
        original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might
        change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind.
        You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to
        a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice some focus
        in exchange for versatility.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

        <p>To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score
        prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in
        the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who
        decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and
        Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a
        beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new
        class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higherthan-average
        ability scores.</p>

        <h2>Experience Points</h2>

        <p>The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your
        total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not
        your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1,
        you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your
        second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.</p>

        <h2>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h2>

        <p>You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels
        after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you
        are a 1st-level character.</p>

        <p>You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form
        your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can
        simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin
        have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit
        Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track
        of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you
        have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.</p>

        <h2>Proficiency Bonus</h2>

        <p>Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level,
        as shown in the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.JournalEntry.5LoAJLkfIYBAgWTW]{Character
        Advancement} table, not your level in a particular class. For example,
        if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a
        5th-level character, which is +3.</p>

        <h2>Proficiencies</h2>

        <p>When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial
        class, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as
        shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.</p>

        <h2>Class Features</h2>

        <p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that
        level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a
        few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel
        Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.</p>

        <h3>Channel Divinity</h3>

        <p>If you already have the Channel Divinity
        (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.YpiLQEKGalROn7iJ]{Cleric}
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Paladin})feature
        and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the
        Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature
        again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses
        only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you.
        For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel
        Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the
        cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can
        choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your
        two classes.</p>

        <h3>Extra Attack</h3>

        <p>If you gain the
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo]{Extra
        Attack} class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add
        together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless
        it says you do (as the fighter’s version of
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.q9g1MLXuLZyxjQMg]{Extra
        Attack} does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.pJADgAxxefgcATWr]{Thirsting
        Blade} doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra
        Attack.</p>

        <h3>Unarmored Defense</h3>

        <p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense
        (@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.SZbsNbaxFFGwBpNK]{Barbarian}
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Item.UAvV7N7T4zJhxdfI]{Monk})
        feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.</p>

        <h3>Spellcasting</h3>

        <p>Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels
        in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in
        those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one
        class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting
        feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that
        class.</p>

        <p><strong>Spells Known and Prepared.</strong> You determine what spells
        you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a
        single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for
        example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in
        the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips,
        and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you
        gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells.
        If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your
        spellbook.</p>

        <p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your
        classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you
        cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol,
        can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that
        focus.</p>

        <p><strong>Spell Slots. </strong>You determine your available spell
        slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid,
        sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the
        paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots
        by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p>

        <p>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give
        you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or
        can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level
        spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an
        enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the
        enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher
        level.</p>

        <p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you
        count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you
        have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level
        slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any
        2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to
        cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.</p>

        <p><strong>Pact Magic.</strong> If you have both the Spellcasting class
        feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can
        use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells
        you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class
        feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting
        class feature to cast warlock spells you know.</p>

        <p>A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a
        character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and
        abilities beyond what a class provides.</p>

        <p>At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement
        feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that
        feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat
        only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.</p>

        <p>You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat.
        If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until
        you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you
        to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13
        somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Grappler
        feat until your Strength is restored.</p>

        <h2>Grappler</h2>

        <p><em>Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher</em></p>

        <p>You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in
        close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:</p>

        <ul>

        <li>You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are
        grappling.</li>

        <li>You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To
        do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature
        are both restrained until the grapple ends.</li>

        </ul>
