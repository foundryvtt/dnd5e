Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.</p>\n<h2>Way of the Open Hand</h2>\n<p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed.

Colleges</h1>\n<h2>College of Lore</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>\n<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>\n<p>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>\n<h3>College of Lore Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.e9ytGikyLFgwZ5wi]{Bonus Proficiencies} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.5zPmHPQUne7RDfaU]{Cutting Words}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.myBu3zi5eYvQIcuy]{Additional Magical Secrets}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.pquwueEMweRhiWaq]{Peerless Skill}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["acr","ani","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","nat","prc","per","prf","rel","slt","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ILvRZGEx3aXqSVUt"}},"img":"icons/skills/toxins/cup-goblet-poisoned-spilled.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"MX29mr6A5oqePYyF","name":"Spellcasting (Bard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock.

particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. </p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<h2>Circle of the Land</h2>\n<p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.</p>\n<h3>Circle of the Land Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"lT8GsPOPgRzDC3QJ\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Bonus Cantrip</a> <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"wKdRtFsvGfMKQHLY\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Natural Recovery</a></p>\n<p>3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"YiK59gWSlcQ6Mbdz\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Circle Spells</a></p>\n<p>6th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"3FB25qKxmkmxcxuC\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Land's Stride (Circle of the Land)</a></p>\n<p>10th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"OTvrJSJSUgAwXrWX\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Nature's Ward</a></p>\n<p>14th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"EuX1kJNIw1F68yus\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Nature's Sanctuary</a></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"}},"img":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"ase8bS7TFIu2A5G7","name":"Spellcasting (Druid)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list.

Origins</h1>\n<p>Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic, such as a draconic bloodline.</p>\n<h2>Draconic Bloodline</h2>\n<p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors.

It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"icons/magic/air/wind-tornado-wall-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3>\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table.

Archetypes</h1>\n<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Thief</h2>\n<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.</p>\n<h3>Thief Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ga3dt2zrCn2MHK8R]{Fast Hands} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.FGrbXs6Ku5qxFK5G]{Second-Story Work}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.Ei1Oh4UAA2E30jcD]{Supreme Sneak}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.NqWyHE7Rpw9lyKWu]{Use Magic Device}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.LhRm1EeUMvp2EWhV]{Thief's Reflexes}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","per","prf","prc","slt","ste"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.xEb8jmA5HlNs7xTF"}},"img":"icons/skills/melee/strike-sword-stabbed-brown.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"kRWtiPib9MRx9JmN","name":"Dagger (offhand)","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A short metal blade mounted to a small hilt and crossguard.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<h2>Oath of Devotion</h2>\n<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>\n<h3>Oath Spells</h3>\n<p>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.xmDBqZhRVrtLP8h2]{Protection from Evil and Good}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.gvdA9nPuWLck4tBl]{Sanctuary}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.CylBa7jR8DSbo8Z3]{Zone of Truth}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ZU9d6woBdUP8pIPt]{Beacon of Hope}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{Dispel Magic}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.da0a1t2FqaTjRZGT]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.TgHsuhNasPbhu8MO]{Guardian of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[dnd5e.spells.d54VDyFulD9xxY7J]{Commune}, @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>\n<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo]{Channel Divinity} options.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.xNN0JMKqlG4hKVYu]{Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.ZdwGlsJNtc7pGFCd]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"img":"icons/skills/melee/weapons-crossed-swords-yellow-teal.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"JdhpBDti3h3tNZai","name":"Relentless Endurance","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.
