The Utility activity allows for rolling an arbitrary formula, adding effects, or simply indicating something occurs without specific functionality. It acts as a catch-all activity for any case where a more specific activity doesn’t make sense.


## Configuring Utility

After creating the Utility activity the configuration sheet will open to the "Identity" tab. In addition to the standard activity identity options (see the [Activities Overview](Activities.md) for more details), Utility also includes a *Utility Roll Prompt* option. This controls whether the rolling dialog is shown when rolling the utility roll (if present).

The "Effect" tab contains the configuration information for the utility roll:
- *Roll Label*: Label used for the rolling button in place of the default "Roll" label
- *Roll Formula*: Formula used for the utility roll
- *Visible to All*: Determines whether the rolling button be visible to all players, or only to the player who used the activity and the GM
