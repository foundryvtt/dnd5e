The Damage activity allows for rolling damage.


## Configuring Damage

![Damage Sheet - Effect Tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e/publish-wiki/wiki/images/activities/damage-effect.jpg)

After creating the Damage activity the configuration sheet will open. Navigate over to the "Effect" tab to see the Damage-specific details plus the actual damage parts:
- *Allow Critical*: Allow critical damage to be rolled
- *Extra Critical Damage*: Extra damage formula that will be added to the first damage part if critical damage is rolled (only visible if "Allow Critical" is checked). This extra damage is not multiplied like the rest of the damage
