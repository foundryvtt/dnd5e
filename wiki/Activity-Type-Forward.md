The Forward activity allows for triggering another activity on the same item with different consumption and scaling.


## Configuring Forward

After creating the Forward activity the configuration sheet will open on the "Identity" tab. The sheet for Forward is simplified compared to other activity sheets, not featuring any activation, duration, or targeting information. In the "Consumption" tab you can configure consumption, uses, and recovery like normal, and any scaling set up will affect the activity being used.

On the "Effect" tab there is only a single option that allows for selecting which activity will be triggered by the Forward activity when used.
