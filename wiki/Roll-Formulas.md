> <details><summary>To explore the data model within Foundry to find the properties detailed below, here are a few approaches:</summary>
>
> • Select a token, then open up the dev tools (F12 on Win; ⌥⌘I on Mac), and paste this into the Console (or save it as a Script macro in your hotbar):
`console.log(canvas.tokens.controlled[0].actor.getRollData());`
>
> • Or: Install the "Autocomplete Inline Properties" module, to be able to just start typing in a supported field and have the available properties pop up (not all systems supported yet).
>
> • Or: Right-click an actor in the sidebar and choose Export Data, which will get you a JSON file you can browse through. (This won’t contain any values that are derived at roll-time.)
