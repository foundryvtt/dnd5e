The "Save Details" section contains values used to determine what kind of save is rolled and what the target DC is:
- *Challenge Ability*: Controls what ability must be used when rolling the saving throw
- *DC Calculation*: Determines how the saving throw DC is calculated, either using the default DC for an ability, the relevant spellcasting DC, or using a custom formula
- *DC Formula*: Place for defining the custom DC formula

The "Save Damage" section contains some configuration details for damage and the actual damage parts:
- *Damage on Save*: Option that added informative text on how much damage should be applied when a creature succeeds on its saving throw
